        "Alarm": "The user, a 25-34 year old unemployed male from the United States, has frequently interacted with the alarm assistant to manage his daily schedule. As a native English speaker with a university degree, he prefers a conversational yet professional tone.\n\nOne of his primary interactions involves setting a recurring weekday alarm for 8:00 AM to maintain a consistent morning routine while job hunting. He has expressed a preference for upbeat music as the alarm sound, often requesting recommendations for energizing playlists or radio stations to start his day on a positive note.\n\nOver time, the user has asked the assistant to adjust the alarm volume incrementally, finding the optimal level to wake him up without being too jarring. He has also requested the ability to customize snooze intervals and set temporary weekend alarms when needed.\n\nIn addition to setting alarms, the user occasionally seeks guidance on developing healthy sleep habits, such as tips for winding down before bedtime or establishing a consistent sleep schedule. He values practical advice tailored to his lifestyle as an unemployed individual.\n\nThe user appreciates the assistant's ability to provide reminders and follow-up prompts, ensuring he doesn't oversleep or miss important appointments. He has also inquired about integrating the alarm with other smart home devices or productivity apps, aiming to streamline his morning routine further.\n\nWhile the user's interactions have primarily focused on alarm management, he has occasionally explored other features, such as setting timers for job application deadlines or scheduling reminders for household chores.
