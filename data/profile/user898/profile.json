Her preferred alarm time is set for 8:30 AM, allowing her to wake up early enough to prepare for classes or other commitments.\n\nInitial interactions involved setting up a recurring weekday alarm with an upbeat music tone, as she finds it more energizing and motivating to start her day. Over time, she has experimented with different alarm sounds, occasionally requesting recommendations for new, upbeat tunes to add variety to her mornings.\n\nThe user appreciates the assistant's ability to set alarms quickly and efficiently, often providing brief commands like \"Set an alarm for 8:30 AM on weekdays\" or \"Change my alarm sound to this song.\" She has also asked the assistant to snooze or reschedule alarms on occasion, particularly during exam periods or when her schedule changes.\n\nOn weekends, the user tends to disable her recurring alarm, preferring to sleep in or wake up naturally. However, she has occasionally requested one-time alarms for specific events or appointments on weekends, demonstrating her flexibility in using the assistant based on her needs.\n\nThe user's interactions with the alarm assistant are typically straightforward and to-the-point, reflecting her busy lifestyle as a student. She values the assistant's reliability and responsiveness in setting alarms accurately and appreciates the ability to customize alarm sounds to her preferences.",
