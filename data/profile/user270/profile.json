He has also asked the assistant to set recurring alarms for weekdays, ensuring he doesn't oversleep during the academic term.\n\nOver time, the user has experimented with different alarm sounds, occasionally requesting nature sounds or motivational quotes to mix up his morning routine. However, he consistently returns to his preference for upbeat music, finding it the most effective in waking him up and boosting his energy levels.\n\nThe user appreciates the assistant's ability to adjust alarm volumes gradually, allowing for a more gentle wake-up experience. He has also requested the assistant to provide weather updates and traffic information alongside his morning alarms, helping him plan his commute or outdoor activities accordingly.\n\nWhile the user's alarm preferences remain relatively consistent during the academic year, he has occasionally asked the assistant to temporarily disable alarms during breaks or holidays, allowing him to sleep in without disruption. Overall, the user values the assistant's reliability and flexibility in managing his morning routine, ensuring he starts his days on time and in a positive mindset.",
        "Books": "The user, an 18-24 year old male university student from Italy, has a deep passion for books, particularly in the fantasy, science-fiction, and thriller genres.

Tolkien, Isaac Asimov, and Dan Brown. He has frequently requested summaries, analyses, and recommendations related to their seminal works, such as The Lord of the Rings, Foundation, and The Da Vinci Code. The user has expressed a particular fondness for the immersive world-building and intricate narratives found in these books and their respective series.\n\nOver time, the user has sought guidance in discovering new authors and titles that align with his literary interests. He has welcomed suggestions for lesser-known gems within his favorite genres, often requesting detailed plot summaries and character analyses to gauge his potential interest. The assistant has also provided recommendations for complementary reads based on the user's affinity for specific themes, such as epic quests, futuristic societies, or historical mysteries.\n\nThe user has a preference for both physical and ebook formats, often inquiring about the availability and pricing of both options. He tends to engage in reading during the evening hours, making it a regular weekly ritual. Consequently, the assistant has tailored its recommendations and discussions to accommodate this reading pattern.\n\nIn addition to seeking new literary discoveries, the user has frequently revisited his favorite books and series, engaging in in-depth discussions about their themes, symbolism, and cultural impact.
