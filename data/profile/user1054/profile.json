        "Alarm": "The user, a university student aged 18-24 from Mexico, frequently interacts with the alarm assistant to manage her weekday schedule. Past interactions show a consistent preference for setting a recurring alarm at 8:30 AM on weekdays, with an upbeat music tone to help her start the day energized.\n\nInitially, the user requested guidance on setting up her first alarm, seeking recommendations for the most effective wake-up sounds. After experimenting with various options, she settled on a lively pop song that gradually increases in volume, finding it motivating and less jarring than traditional alarm tones.\n\nOver time, the user developed a routine of checking in with the assistant every Sunday evening to confirm her weekday alarms were properly set. She appreciated the assistant's ability to provide reminders and double-check the alarm details, ensuring she wouldn't oversleep for her morning classes.\n\nDuring exam periods or when anticipating a hectic week, the user would occasionally request additional alarms, such as a gentle reminder an hour before her usual wake-up time or a mid-afternoon alert to stay on track with her study schedule.\n\nThe user's interactions often reflected a friendly and casual tone, with occasional expressions of gratitude or frustration depending on her morning experiences. She valued the assistant's ability to make adjustments quickly, like temporarily disabling alarms on weekends or changing the alarm sound to suit her mood.\n\nAs she progressed through her studies, the user began exploring features like alarm labels and customizable snooze durations, seeking greater personalization to align with her evolving schedule. She also inquired about integrating the alarm with her calendar, aiming to streamline her time management further.",
