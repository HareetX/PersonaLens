        "Alarm": "The user, a 55-64 year old divorced woman from the United Kingdom working full-time with a graduate degree, has engaged with the alarm assistant primarily for managing her weekday morning routine. Past interactions show a preference for a gentle nature sound alarm set for 7:00 AM on weekdays.\n\nInitially, the user requested a simple recurring weekday alarm to wake her up for work. Over time, she started exploring different alarm sound options, settling on a soothing nature track that helped her ease into the morning. She appreciated the ability to preview alarm tones before setting them.\n\nThe user has occasionally asked for temporary adjustments to her alarm schedule, such as setting it an hour earlier or later for specific days. She values the flexibility to make these changes easily through voice commands or a user-friendly interface.\n\nIn addition to the weekday alarm, the user has sporadically requested weekend alarms, typically for later morning times like 9:00 AM. However, these one-off alarms are infrequent, as she prefers to have a more relaxed schedule on her days off.\n\nThe user has provided positive feedback on the reliability of the alarm system and the ability to customize snooze intervals and alarm volume levels.
