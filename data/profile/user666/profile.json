With a busy work schedule, she values the convenience of setting recurring weekday alarms to ensure she wakes up on time for her job.\n\nPast interactions show a consistent preference for a gentle nature sound alarm tone, set to go off at 7:30 AM each weekday morning. The user appreciates the assistant's ability to confirm and reiterate her alarm settings, providing peace of mind that she won't oversleep.\n\nOver time, the user has experimented with different alarm tones, occasionally requesting soothing rain or bird sounds for a relaxing wake-up experience. However, she always returns to her preferred gentle nature sound, finding it the most effective in gradually rousing her without causing abrupt disruption.\n\nThe user has also explored the assistant's capabilities in setting temporary alarms for weekends or special occasions. For instance, she has requested one-time alarms for early morning flights or important appointments, appreciating the flexibility to customize alarm times as needed.\n\nAdditionally, the user has provided feedback on the assistant's alarm management features, suggesting improvements such as the ability to set multiple alarms with different tones or snooze durations. She values clear and concise confirmations of her alarm settings and has expressed appreciation for the assistant's consistent reliability in ensuring she starts her day on time.",
