Past interactions show a consistent preference for setting a recurring alarm at 6:00 AM on weekdays to wake up for work. \n\nHe favors a gradual increase in alarm sound volume rather than an abrupt, jarring noise. In one instance, he asked the assistant to recommend soothing nature sounds or light instrumental music for his alarm tone. Over time, he has experimented with different tones but often returns to the same gentle chime sound.\n\nThe user appreciates the ability to adjust alarm settings with simple voice commands. He has requested the addition of a \"snooze\" functionality, allowing him to temporarily silence the alarm for short periods. There were a few instances where he provided feedback that the alarm was not going off at the scheduled time, prompting the assistant to troubleshoot and ensure accurate timekeeping.\n\nWhile the user primarily relies on the alarm for weekday mornings, he has occasionally set one-time alarms for important weekend events or appointments. He values the assistant's reminders and confirmations when setting new alarms to avoid missed or duplicate alarms.\n\nThe user's interactions reflect a desire for a straightforward and reliable alarm experience, with a focus on consistent weekday scheduling and a preference for gentle, non-intrusive alarm tones. He appreciates the assistant's ability to understand and adapt to his specific alarm needs and preferences over time.",
