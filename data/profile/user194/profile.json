He enjoys waking up to upbeat music, often requesting the assistant to set the alarm sound to energetic pop or hip-hop tracks.\n\nOver time, the user has developed a routine of asking the assistant to confirm his alarm settings the night before, ensuring he doesn't oversleep or miss important lectures. He appreciates the assistant's ability to provide clear and concise confirmations, as well as reminders about upcoming alarms.\n\nOn occasion, the user has requested the assistant to adjust his alarm time or sound based on specific circumstances, such as an early morning exam or a late-night study session.
