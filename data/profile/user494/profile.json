        "Alarm": "The user, a 35-44 year old non-binary individual from Israel, has frequently interacted with the alarm assistant to manage their weekday schedule. As someone seeking employment, they value the ability to set consistent wake-up alarms to maintain a routine.\n\nEarly interactions focused on finding the perfect alarm sound, with the user expressing a preference for gentle nature sounds over jarring tones. They settled on a soothing bird song after sampling various options provided by the assistant.\n\nOver time, the user established a pattern of setting a recurring 8:00 AM alarm for weekdays, appreciating the assistant's ability to customize the alarm schedule based on their needs. They occasionally adjusted the time for job interviews or other appointments, requesting temporary one-time alarms.\n\nThe user has provided feedback on the alarm interface, suggesting improvements such as the ability to set multiple alarms with different sounds and the option to gradually increase the volume for a more gentle wake-up experience.\n\nThey have also explored features like alarm labels and notes, using them to set reminders for follow-up tasks after waking up, such as \"Check job listings\" or \"Call potential employer.\"\n\nWhile the user's tone is generally polite and appreciative, they have expressed frustration when the assistant misunderstood their alarm preferences or failed to set an alarm correctly.
