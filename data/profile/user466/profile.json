He prefers a gradual increase in alarm sound volume to gently wake him up at 7:30 AM on weekdays.\n\nIn the initial interactions, the user set up a recurring weekday alarm with the preferred sound and volume settings. He has occasionally asked the assistant to confirm or modify the alarm time based on his schedule changes.\n\nOver time, the user has provided feedback on the alarm experience, requesting adjustments to the final alarm volume level and the rate of volume increase. He has also explored different alarm sound options, gravitating towards nature-inspired sounds like bird calls or ocean waves.\n\nThe user appreciates the assistant's ability to set multiple alarms with different labels (e.g., \"Work Alarm,\" \"Gym Alarm\") and has requested features like snooze customization and automatic alarm deactivation on weekends and holidays.\n\nAdditionally, he has inquired about integrating the alarm system with his smart home devices, such as gradually increasing the bedroom light intensity or adjusting the thermostat temperature before the alarm goes off.\n\nThe user values a straightforward and efficient interaction style, preferring concise confirmations and status updates regarding his alarm settings. He has occasionally provided feedback on the assistant's language and tone, favoring a more conversational and friendly approach while maintaining professionalism.",
