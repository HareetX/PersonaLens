As a native English speaker with a bachelor's degree, she prefers a straightforward and efficient interaction style.\n\nHer typical interaction involves setting a recurring weekday alarm for 7:00 AM, with an upbeat music tone to help her start the day energized. She has expressed a preference for the alarm to be labeled \"Work Day\" for easy identification.\n\nOver time, the user has requested additional features, such as the ability to snooze the alarm for 10 minutes with a simple voice command. She has also asked for the option to set a backup alarm for 7:15 AM, in case she oversleeps.\n\nDuring holidays or weekends, the user often disables her recurring alarm or sets a later wake-up time, around 9:00 AM. She appreciates the assistant's ability to remember her preferences and adjust the alarm settings accordingly.\n\nOccasionally, the user provides feedback on the alarm tones, requesting a rotation of different upbeat music tracks to avoid monotony. She has also inquired about the possibility of integrating the alarm with her smart home devices, such as gradually increasing the brightness of her bedroom lights before the alarm goes off.\n\nOverall, the user values the assistant's efficiency in managing her morning alarm routine, allowing her to start her workdays on time and with energy. She appreciates the personalized touch and the ability to customize the alarm experience to her preferences.",
