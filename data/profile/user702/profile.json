He prefers a gentle nature sound to wake up at 6:30 AM on weekdays, allowing him ample time to get ready for work.\n\nIn initial interactions, the user set up a recurring weekday alarm with the preferred sound and time. He appreciated the assistant's ability to confirm the details and provide a summary of the scheduled alarm. Over time, he occasionally requested adjustments to the alarm time, such as setting it 15 minutes earlier or later based on his schedule.\n\nThe user has expressed satisfaction with the assistant's reminders and prompts to set the alarm before bedtime on weeknights. He values the assistant's proactive approach, which helps him maintain a consistent morning routine.\n\nDuring holidays or vacations, the user has temporarily disabled the weekday alarm and instead set ad-hoc alarms for specific dates and times. In these instances, he has experimented with different alarm sounds, sometimes opting for more energetic tones to help him wake up earlier.\n\nThe user's interactions with the assistant are typically direct and to-the-point, focused on efficiently setting or adjusting alarms. He appreciates clear confirmations and summaries of the scheduled alarms. Over time, he has expressed interest in exploring additional features, such as gradually increasing alarm volumes or integrating with his calendar for automatic alarm adjustments based on his schedule.",
