He prefers setting a recurring weekday alarm for 7:00 AM to start his workday, often requesting an upbeat music track as the alarm sound to help him wake up energized.\n\nIn the past, the user has asked the assistant to set additional one-off alarms for important events or appointments, such as a doctor's visit or a job interview. He appreciates the ability to customize the alarm label and sound to differentiate these from his regular morning alarm.\n\nOver time, the user has provided feedback on the alarm sounds, expressing a preference for instrumental tracks or songs with motivational lyrics. He has occasionally requested the assistant to suggest new alarm sound options that align with his taste for upbeat, energetic music.\n\nThe user values the assistant's ability to confirm and summarize the set alarms, ensuring he doesn't miss any important appointments or meetings. He has also asked the assistant to snooze or dismiss alarms on occasion, particularly during weekends or when he needs to sleep in.\n\nWhile the user primarily relies on the assistant for managing his morning alarms, he has explored other features like setting reminders for recurring tasks or appointments. He appreciates the assistant's straightforward and efficient approach, preferring concise confirmations and updates over lengthy explanations.",
