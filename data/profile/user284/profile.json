Her preferred alarm time is set for 7:30 AM, allowing her ample time to get ready for classes.\n\nIn the initial interactions, the user requested a gentle nature sound as her alarm tone, finding it a soothing way to start her day. She also set up recurring weekday alarms, eliminating the need for daily adjustments.\n\nOver time, the user has provided feedback on the alarm experience. She occasionally asks for the alarm volume to be slightly increased, as she tends to be a deep sleeper. Additionally, she has requested the ability to set multiple alarms with different tones for variety.\n\nThe user appreciates the assistant's ability to confirm alarm settings and provide reminders the night before. She has expressed interest in exploring features that gradually increase the alarm volume or integrate with smart home devices to automate her morning routine, such as turning on lights or playing her favorite playlist.\n\nWhile the user primarily relies on the alarm for weekdays, she occasionally sets weekend alarms for specific events or appointments. In these instances, she prefers a more upbeat alarm tone to help her wake up energized.\n\nThe user's interactions with the alarm assistant reflect her preference for a seamless and personalized experience that aligns with her daily routine as a busy university student. She values the assistant's ability to adapt to her evolving needs while maintaining a user-friendly and efficient interface.",
