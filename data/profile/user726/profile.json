She prefers a gentle nature sound to wake up at 7:00 AM on weekdays.\n\nIn their initial interactions, the user set up a recurring weekday alarm for 7:00 AM with the nature sounds she enjoys. She provided feedback that the sounds were calming yet effective in waking her up without being jarring. Over time, she occasionally adjusted the alarm time by 15-30 minutes earlier or later based on her schedule.\n\nThe user appreciates the assistant's ability to confirm and summarize her alarm settings clearly. She has requested the occasional weekend alarm for early morning plans but typically prefers not having an alarm on Saturdays and Sundays.\n\nWhen traveling for work, the user asks the assistant to temporarily disable her recurring alarm and set a new alarm time adjusted for her trip's time zone. Upon returning home, she reinstates her regular 7:00 AM weekday alarm routine.\n\nThe user has explored different nature sound options like bird songs, ocean waves, and rainforest ambience. While she enjoys variety, she tends to revert to her favorite gentle stream sound for most days. Her interactions are polite yet concise, reflecting her professional yet down-to-earth personality.",
