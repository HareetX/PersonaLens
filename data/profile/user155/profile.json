        "Alarm": "The user, a 35-44 year old male from Chile working full-time, frequently interacts with the assistant to manage his weekday morning alarms. Past interactions show a consistent preference for setting a recurring alarm at 7:00 AM from Monday to Friday, with a gradual increase in volume for the alarm sound.\n\nInitially, the user requested a simple weekday alarm setup with the default sound. Over time, he provided feedback about finding the default sound too jarring and asked the assistant to recommend gentler alarm tones that increase in volume gradually. After exploring a few options, he settled on a natural sound like birds chirping.\n\nThe user appreciates the assistant's ability to set the alarm quickly with just a voice command like \"Set my weekday alarm for 7 AM with a gradual bird sound.\" He has occasionally asked for confirmation of the alarm details the night before.\n\nOn a few instances when his schedule changed, the user requested temporary adjustments to the alarm timing, such as setting it an hour earlier or disabling it for a specific day. He has also asked the assistant to provide a summary of active alarms for the upcoming week.\n\nWhile the user primarily uses the alarm for weekday mornings, he has explored setting occasional weekend alarms for appointments or travel. In these cases, he tends to prefer a later alarm time around 9 AM and has experimented with different sounds like ocean waves or gentle piano music.\n\nThe user appreciates the assistant's ability to remember his preferences and provide a seamless alarm management experience without requiring extensive customization each time. He values the convenience and responsiveness of the voice interface for this routine task.",
