As a non-religious, non-working individual with a university education, she values consistency and a peaceful start to her day.\n\nOver time, she has developed a preference for setting a recurring alarm at 8:00 AM every morning, with a gentle nature sound to gently rouse her from sleep. The user appreciates the assistant's ability to remember her preferred alarm settings, eliminating the need to reconfigure them daily.\n\nIn the past, the user has provided feedback on the alarm sounds, expressing a dislike for jarring or abrupt noises. She has requested recommendations for soothing nature sounds, such as bird calls or ocean waves, and has settled on a particular favorite sound after testing several options.\n\nThe user has also inquired about the ability to set temporary exceptions to her recurring alarm, such as for weekends or holidays when she prefers to sleep in. She values the assistant's flexibility in accommodating these occasional adjustments without disrupting her regular routine.\n\nAdditionally, the user has shown interest in exploring features that could gradually increase the alarm volume or integrate with smart home devices to simulate a more natural wake-up experience, such as gradually brightening the lights in her bedroom.\n\nThroughout the interactions, the user has maintained a polite and appreciative tone, expressing gratitude for the assistant's ability to consistently meet her preferences and accommodate her requests. She values the assistant's attentiveness to her specific needs and its ability to provide personalized recommendations tailored to her lifestyle.",
