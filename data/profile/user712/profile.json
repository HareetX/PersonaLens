Past interactions show a consistent preference for setting a recurring alarm for 6:30 AM on weekdays, with a gentle nature sound as the alarm tone.\n\nInitially, the user requested a simple weekday alarm setup, expressing a desire for a soothing wake-up experience. Over time, she provided feedback on preferred alarm sounds, settling on a gentle nature melody that gradually increases in volume. The user has occasionally asked for temporary adjustments to the alarm time, such as setting it 30 minutes earlier or later to accommodate changes in her schedule.\n\nIn addition to the recurring weekday alarm, the user has occasionally set one-time alarms for weekend mornings, typically between 7:00 AM and 8:00 AM. She has expressed appreciation for the assistant's ability to provide a summary of upcoming alarms and the option to snooze or dismiss them easily.\n\nThe user's interactions with the assistant reflect a preference for simplicity and efficiency. She values the ability to quickly set or adjust alarms without unnecessary prompts or complications. Her tone is often direct and to-the-point, though she has occasionally provided positive feedback when the assistant's recommendations align with her preferences.\n\nOver time, the user has explored additional features, such as setting multiple alarms with different tones or requesting weather updates alongside the alarm. However, her core preference remains a straightforward weekday alarm setup with a gentle nature sound, reflecting her desire for a peaceful start to her workday routine.",
