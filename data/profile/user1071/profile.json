She favors natural sounds like bird calls or flowing water as her alarm tone, finding them soothing and conducive to a peaceful start to the day.\n\nOver time, the user has expressed a preference for the assistant to provide a brief weather forecast and daily affirmation along with the alarm notification. She appreciates the assistant's ability to adjust the alarm volume gradually, allowing for a gentle wake-up experience.\n\nDuring exam periods or when her schedule changes, the user often requests temporary adjustments to her alarm timings or the addition of weekend alarms. She values the assistant's flexibility in accommodating these modifications while still maintaining her preferred alarm sound and volume settings.\n\nThe user has also explored the assistant's capabilities in setting reminders for important deadlines or events, appreciating the integration of alarms and reminders into a cohesive time management system. She has provided feedback on the clarity of the assistant's voice and the intuitive nature of the alarm setup process, suggesting improvements where necessary.\n\nOverall, the user's interactions with the alarm assistant reflect her desire for a peaceful and organized start to her day, aligning with her cultural background and personal preferences for a gentle, nature-inspired experience.",
