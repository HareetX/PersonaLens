She prefers a gentle nature sound to wake up at 7:30 AM on weekdays, allowing her ample time to get ready for work or other commitments.\n\nInitially, the user simply requested the assistant to set a recurring weekday alarm for 7:30 AM with a nature sound. Over time, she started providing more specific feedback, such as adjusting the alarm volume or requesting a different nature sound like bird calls or ocean waves.\n\nThe user appreciates the assistant's ability to remember her preferences and set the alarm accordingly without needing to repeat the details each time. She has also asked the assistant to provide weather updates along with the alarm, helping her plan her morning routine and outfit.\n\nOn occasion, the user has requested temporary adjustments to her alarm schedule, such as setting an earlier alarm for important meetings or appointments. In these cases, she expects the assistant to revert to her regular 7:30 AM weekday alarm after the specified date.\n\nThe user has expressed interest in exploring additional alarm customization options, such as gradually increasing the alarm volume or incorporating motivational quotes or affirmations into her morning routine. She values the assistant's ability to adapt to her evolving preferences while maintaining a consistent and reliable alarm experience during the workweek.",
