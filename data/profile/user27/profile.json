She prefers to wake up at 7:00 AM with a gradually increasing alarm sound to ease into her day.\n\nIn her initial interactions, the user set a recurring weekday alarm for 7:00 AM with a gentle, gradually increasing tone. She expressed a preference for avoiding jarring or abrupt alarm sounds, as she finds them disruptive to her morning mindset.\n\nOver time, the user has fine-tuned her alarm preferences, occasionally requesting temporary adjustments to accommodate changes in her schedule. For instance, when anticipating a late work night, she would ask the assistant to set a one-time alarm for 8:00 AM the following morning.\n\nThe user appreciates the assistant's ability to provide reminders and confirmations for her alarm settings, ensuring she starts her day on time. She has also inquired about the option to set multiple alarms with different tones, indicating a potential interest in exploring more customized wake-up routines.\n\nAdditionally, the user has sought guidance on integrating her alarm with other smart home devices, such as gradually increasing the brightness of her bedroom lights or playing soothing music upon waking up. She values a seamless, personalized morning experience that aligns with her preferences for a calm and organized start to her day.\n\nWhile the user's interactions have primarily focused on her weekday routine, she has occasionally requested weekend alarms for specific events or appointments, demonstrating a willingness to adapt her alarm usage based on her changing needs.",
