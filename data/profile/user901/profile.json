Her preferred alarm time is set for 7:30 AM on weekdays, allowing her to wake up and get ready for work without rushing.\n\nInitially, the user requested a gentle nature sound as her alarm tone, finding harsh beeps or loud music jarring first thing in the morning. Over time, she has experimented with different soothing sounds like ocean waves or bird calls to find the most pleasant way to start her day.\n\nThe user values consistency in her alarm settings during the workweek but is more flexible on weekends, sometimes setting later alarms or skipping the alarm altogether depending on her plans. She has provided feedback that the assistant's ability to automatically set recurring weekday alarms has been incredibly helpful in establishing a reliable routine.\n\nIn terms of interaction style, the user prefers a straightforward approach when setting or adjusting alarms, using simple commands like \"Set an alarm for 7:30 AM on weekdays\" or \"Change my alarm sound to rainforest sounds.\" She has occasionally asked for recommendations on calming alarm tones when looking to switch things up.\n\nThe user has also requested the ability to set temporary overrides for upcoming days off or appointments, appreciating the flexibility to easily adjust her normal alarm schedule as needed. Overall, her interactions reflect a desire for a seamless, low-maintenance alarm experience that supports her lifestyle as a working professional.",
