She prefers a gentle nature sound as her alarm tone, finding it a soothing way to start her day without feeling jarred awake.\n\nOn occasion, the user has requested adjustments to her alarm time, either to accommodate an early exam or to sleep in during university breaks. She appreciates the assistant's ability to make temporary changes while preserving her regular weekday alarm settings.\n\nOver time, the user has expressed interest in exploring additional alarm features, such as setting multiple alarms for different purposes (e.g., a separate alarm for workout reminders) or integrating her alarm with a personalized morning routine that includes weather updates and a daily schedule overview.\n\nThe user's interactions with the assistant are typically concise and direct, reflecting her busy student lifestyle. She values efficiency and appreciates the assistant's ability to quickly understand and execute her alarm-related requests without unnecessary prompts or clarifications.",
