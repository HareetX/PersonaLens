As a native English speaker with a vocational education background, she prefers a straightforward and efficient interaction style.\n\nOne of her recurring requests is to set a gentle nature sound alarm for 7:30 AM on weekdays, aligning with her preference for a peaceful wake-up experience. She has occasionally asked for temporary adjustments to the alarm time, such as setting it an hour earlier for important appointments or meetings.\n\nOver time, the user has provided feedback on the alarm sounds, expressing a liking for the soothing ocean waves and bird song options. She has also inquired about the ability to set multiple alarms, indicating a potential need for additional reminders beyond her primary morning alarm.\n\nOccasionally, the user has requested to snooze or dismiss the alarm, often citing unexpected changes in her schedule or oversleeping. In these instances, she appreciates a seamless experience without excessive prompts or confirmations.\n\nWhile the user's interactions have primarily focused on setting and managing her weekday alarm, she has shown interest in exploring additional features like alarm labeling or customizable alarm tones. However, her overall preference remains a simple and intuitive interface that aligns with her practical approach to alarm management.",
