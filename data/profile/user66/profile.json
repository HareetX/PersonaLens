Past interactions indicate a preference for a gentle nature sound to wake up at 9:30 AM on weekdays.\n\nInitially, the user struggled with setting the alarm correctly due to the language barrier, often requesting clarification or rephrasing of instructions. However, over time, they became more comfortable with the assistant's guidance and started exploring additional features like snooze durations and alarm labels.\n\nThe user appreciates the assistant's patient and clear communication style, often providing positive feedback when the alarm setup process is straightforward. They have occasionally requested changes to the alarm sound, experimenting with different nature sounds before settling on a preference for gentle bird calls.\n\nWhile the user's interactions have been consistent in terms of alarm time and recurrence, they have shown interest in exploring weekend alarm options, particularly for leisurely mornings or specific events. The user has also inquired about the ability to set multiple alarms with different sounds, indicating a potential need for more customization as their routines evolve.\n\nOverall, the user values the assistant's reliability in setting accurate alarms and appreciates the gentle wake-up experience provided by the nature sounds. As their English proficiency improves, they may become more inclined to engage in more detailed conversations or request advanced alarm features.",

He often requests recommendations for books similar to his favorites, seeking new authors and stories that capture the essence of science-fiction, fantasy, and psychological thrillers.\n\nThe user values the assistant's ability to provide concise yet insightful book summaries, character analyses, and thematic explorations.
