He has occasionally asked the assistant to cancel or reschedule his alarm for weekends or holidays, valuing the flexibility to adjust his routine as needed.\n\nIn addition to setting alarms, the user has inquired about integrating the assistant with other smart home devices, such as gradually increasing the bedroom lighting or adjusting the thermostat temperature before his wake-up time.
