Past interactions reveal a preference for setting a recurring alarm for 7:00 AM on weekdays, allowing her ample time to prepare for work.\n\nShe appreciates the ability to customize the alarm sound, opting for gentle nature sounds like bird calls or ocean waves to start her day in a calming manner. On occasion, she has requested the assistant to set additional one-time alarms for important meetings or appointments that fall outside her regular schedule.\n\nOver time, the user has provided feedback to fine-tune the alarm volume and snooze intervals to her liking. She values the assistant's ability to confirm alarm settings clearly and provide reminders the night before to ensure a smooth morning.\n\nThe user has also explored the option of setting weekend alarms with later times, though she tends to prefer waking up naturally on her days off. She has inquired about the possibility of integrating the alarm with her calendar or to-do list, aiming to streamline her time management further.\n\nWhile generally satisfied with the alarm's reliability, the user has occasionally expressed frustration when the alarm fails to go off as scheduled, emphasizing the importance of consistent performance for her punctual work routine. She appreciates the assistant's patient and professional approach in addressing any issues or concerns.",
