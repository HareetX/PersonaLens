Her preferred alarm time is set for 8:30 AM on weekdays, allowing her to start her job search routine early in the morning.\n\nInitially, the user requested a gentle nature sound as her alarm tone, finding it a soothing way to wake up. However, after a few weeks, she provided feedback that the sound was too soft, and she often slept through it. The assistant then suggested a slightly louder bird chirping sound, which the user found more effective in waking her up without being too jarring.\n\nOver time, the user has developed a consistent routine of asking the assistant to set her weekday alarm before going to bed. She occasionally requests the assistant to confirm the alarm details, ensuring it is set correctly for the next morning. On weekends, she typically asks the assistant to disable the recurring alarm, allowing her to sleep in without interruptions.\n\nThe user appreciates the assistant's ability to understand and adapt to her preferences. She has expressed satisfaction with the seamless alarm management process, which helps her maintain a structured morning routine during her job search. Additionally, she has inquired about the possibility of setting multiple alarms or customizing the alarm volume, indicating a potential interest in exploring more advanced alarm features in the future.",

She has provided feedback on books she has enjoyed or disliked, allowing the assistant to refine its understanding of her literary tastes. Additionally, the user has inquired about upcoming releases from her favorite authors and has asked for reminders to be set for their publication dates.\n\nThe user prefers to read physical books or ebooks and typically engages in reading during the evening hours on a weekly basis.
