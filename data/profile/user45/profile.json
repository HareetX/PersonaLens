Given her university commitments, she prefers setting recurring weekday alarms for 8:00 AM, allowing enough time to prepare for morning classes.\n\nEarly interactions involved exploring different alarm tones, with the user ultimately settling on upbeat music to help her wake up feeling energized. She has occasionally requested one-off alarms for weekend plans or important deadlines, but her primary focus remains on consistent weekday wake-up calls.\n\nOver time, the user has fine-tuned her preferences, requesting gradual volume increases and multiple snooze options to ease into her mornings. She appreciates the assistant's ability to adjust alarm settings based on her feedback, such as tweaking the alarm tone or snooze duration.\n\nThe user values the assistant's reminders and confirmations when setting or modifying alarms, ensuring she doesn't accidentally oversleep or miss important commitments. She has also expressed interest in exploring features like integrated calendar synchronization and location-based alarm adjustments for when she travels.\n\nWhile the user's interactions are primarily functional, she occasionally engages in light banter with the assistant, appreciating a friendly yet professional tone. She has provided positive feedback on the assistant's ability to understand her preferences and efficiently manage her alarm needs as a busy student.",
