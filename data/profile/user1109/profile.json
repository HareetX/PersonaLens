As a working professional with a graduate degree, she values punctuality and organization.\n\nInitially, the user set a recurring weekday alarm for 7:00 AM with a gentle nature sound, allowing her to start her day calmly. Over time, she requested the ability to customize the alarm label, naming it \"Work Day Routine\" for clarity.\n\nOn occasion, the user has asked the assistant to temporarily adjust the alarm time, either setting it earlier for important meetings or pushing it back on days when she can sleep in. She appreciates the flexibility to make these changes seamlessly through voice commands or a user-friendly interface.\n\nThe user has also explored additional features, such as setting a backup alarm a few minutes after the primary one, ensuring she doesn't oversleep. She has provided feedback on improving the snooze functionality, suggesting a gradual increase in alarm volume for a more gentle wake-up experience.\n\nAs her needs evolved, the user began setting weekend alarms with different tones and times, allowing for a more relaxed schedule. She has expressed interest in integrating the alarm with her calendar, automatically adjusting times based on scheduled events or travel plans.\n\nThroughout the interactions, the user has maintained a polite and appreciative tone, providing constructive feedback to enhance the assistant's capabilities. She values an intuitive and personalized experience, tailored to her preferences and lifestyle as a working professional in New Zealand.",
