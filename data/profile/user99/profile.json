Over time, he has provided feedback to fine-tune the alarm sound, settling on a soothing bird song that gradually increases in volume.\n\nThe user occasionally asks the assistant to confirm or adjust the alarm time, particularly when his work schedule changes or during holidays. He appreciates the assistant's ability to provide clear confirmations and reminders about the active alarm settings.\n\nIn one instance, the user sought guidance on setting multiple alarms for different purposes, such as a secondary alarm for his wife's schedule. The assistant provided step-by-step instructions, and the user successfully set up separate alarms with distinct sounds.\n\nWhile the user's primary interaction revolves around alarm management, he has occasionally inquired about the assistant's other capabilities, expressing curiosity about potential applications in areas like task scheduling or reminders.\n\nThe user values the assistant's reliability and responsiveness, particularly in ensuring his alarms are set correctly for the upcoming week. He has provided positive feedback on the assistant's ability to understand and accommodate his preferences, fostering a sense of trust in the alarm management process.",
