Past interactions show a preference for setting a recurring alarm for 8:00 AM on weekdays, allowing her to wake up on time for classes or study sessions.\n\nInitially, the user requested a gentle nature sound as her alarm tone, finding it a soothing way to start her mornings. However, after a few instances of oversleeping, she asked the assistant to gradually increase the alarm volume over time to ensure she wakes up promptly.\n\nThe user has expressed appreciation for the assistant's ability to set multiple alarms with customized labels, helping her differentiate between class schedules and personal reminders. She has also requested the integration of weather updates with her morning alarms, allowing her to plan her outfit and commute accordingly.\n\nOver time, the user's interactions have evolved to include requests for weekend alarm flexibility, setting later wake-up times or disabling alarms altogether to accommodate her social plans or study schedules. She has also inquired about the possibility of setting location-based alarms, which could be useful during her upcoming study abroad semester.\n\nThe user values the assistant's straightforward and efficient approach to alarm management, preferring clear confirmations and reminders without excessive verbosity. She has provided feedback on the clarity of the alarm instructions and has occasionally sought troubleshooting assistance when encountering issues with alarm dismissal or snooze functionality.",
