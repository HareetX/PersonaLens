        "Alarm": "The user, a 25-34 year old working professional from Hungary, frequently interacts with the alarm assistant to manage her weekday morning routine. Past interactions reveal a preference for a gentle nature sound alarm set for 7:00 AM on weekdays.\n\nInitially, the user requested a simple weekday alarm to wake up for work. Over time, she started exploring different alarm sound options, ultimately settling on a soothing nature soundtrack to start her day. She appreciates the ability to preview alarm tones before setting them.\n\nThe user has expressed frustration with oversleeping and has occasionally asked the assistant to set multiple backup alarms a few minutes apart as a failsafe. She values the snooze functionality and has provided feedback on her preferred snooze intervals.\n\nDuring holidays or vacations, the user temporarily disables her weekday alarm but often sets ad-hoc alarms for specific dates and times, such as reminders for travel or appointments. She has inquired about integrating her calendar events with the alarm system for automatic reminders.\n\nThe user's interactions suggest a desire for simplicity and efficiency in managing her alarms. She appreciates clear confirmations of alarm settings and the ability to review or modify existing alarms easily.
