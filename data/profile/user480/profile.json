They have expressed a preference for a gentle nature sound alarm set for 9:00 AM on weekdays, aligning with their university routine.\n\nIn the initial interactions, the user requested guidance on setting up a recurring weekday alarm with a soothing bird song sound. They appreciated the assistant's ability to walk them through the process step-by-step, ensuring the alarm was correctly configured.\n\nOver time, the user began experimenting with different alarm tones, occasionally requesting a change to a soft rainfall or ocean wave sound for variety. They also asked the assistant to set temporary one-time alarms for important deadlines or appointments, valuing the flexibility to customize alarm times as needed.\n\nThe user has provided positive feedback on the assistant's clear and concise instructions, as well as its ability to confirm alarm settings before activation. They have also inquired about the possibility of setting multiple alarms with different sounds for specific purposes, such as a separate alarm for weekend sleep schedules.\n\nAdditionally, the user has expressed interest in exploring features that gradually increase the alarm volume or integrate with smart home devices to control lights or temperature upon waking. They appreciate the assistant's patient and inclusive approach, respecting their non-binary identity and preferred pronouns.",
