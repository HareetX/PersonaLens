He has expressed appreciation for the assistant's ability to reliably set and adjust alarms based on his preferences.\n\nOver time, the user began requesting additional features, such as the ability to snooze the alarm for a customizable duration or to set temporary one-off alarms for weekends or special occasions. He values the assistant's flexibility in accommodating these requests seamlessly.\n\nThe user has occasionally provided feedback on the alarm sounds, suggesting alternative nature-inspired options like ocean waves or bird calls. He has also inquired about the possibility of integrating the alarm with his smart home devices, allowing for gradual lighting adjustments or automated coffee brewing upon alarm activation.\n\nWhile the user's core preferences for weekday morning alarms have remained consistent, he has shown an interest in exploring additional functionalities to enhance his overall experience. The interactions often involve direct requests, feedback, and occasional inquiries about new features or customization options.",
