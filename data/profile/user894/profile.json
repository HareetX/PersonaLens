Past interactions show a consistent preference for setting a recurring alarm at 7:00 AM on weekdays, with a gradual increase in alarm sound volume.\n\nInitially, the user requested a simple alarm setup with a standard tone, but over time, he has experimented with different alarm sounds, seeking a gentle yet effective way to wake up. He has expressed interest in nature-inspired sounds like bird calls or ocean waves, as well as instrumental melodies.\n\nThe user values the ability to easily adjust alarm settings based on his schedule. For instance, he has asked the assistant to temporarily disable the weekday alarm during holidays or to set a one-time alarm for weekend plans. He has also requested reminders to be sent the night before, prompting him to confirm or adjust the alarm time as needed.\n\nAs the user's work responsibilities have evolved, he has shown interest in additional features like integrating calendar events or traffic updates into his morning routine. He has inquired about the possibility of setting multiple alarms with different tones or snooze intervals, depending on the urgency of his schedule.\n\nThe user appreciates the assistant's ability to understand and adapt to his preferences over time, providing a personalized alarm experience. He values clear and concise confirmations of alarm settings and has occasionally provided feedback on the assistant's tone and communication style, preferring a friendly yet professional approach.",
