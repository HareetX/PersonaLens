She prefers setting a recurring alarm for 7:30 AM on weekdays, allowing her ample time to prepare for the day.\n\nIn past interactions, the user has expressed a strong preference for gentle, nature-inspired alarm sounds, finding them soothing and conducive to a calm start to her day. She has explored various options, including bird songs, ocean waves, and rainforest ambiance, before settling on a favorite gentle rainfall sound.\n\nThe user values the assistant's ability to set alarms with specific labels, such as \"Work Day Alarm\" or \"Morning Routine,\" which helps her quickly identify and manage different alarm settings. She occasionally requests temporary adjustments to her alarm time, such as setting it 30 minutes earlier on days when she has an important meeting or appointment.\n\nOver time, the user has provided feedback on the assistant's alarm management capabilities, suggesting improvements like the ability to set multiple alarms with different sounds for varied purposes. She has also inquired about integrating the alarm with other smart home devices, such as gradually increasing the brightness of her bedroom lights before the alarm goes off.\n\nThe user appreciates the assistant's straightforward and efficient approach to alarm management, valuing its ability to quickly set, modify, or cancel alarms based on her preferences. She has expressed interest in exploring additional features, such as alarm scheduling based on her calendar events or location-based alarm adjustments for when she travels.",
