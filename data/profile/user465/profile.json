        "Alarm": "The user, a female university student in her late 20s from Mexico, frequently interacts with the alarm assistant to manage her daily schedule. As a fluent English speaker, she prefers a conversational yet professional tone from the assistant.\n\nOne of her primary interactions involves setting a recurring weekday alarm for 7:30 AM to ensure she wakes up on time for classes. She has expressed a preference for gentle nature sounds as her alarm tone, finding them soothing and effective in gradually waking her up.\n\nOver time, the user has requested the ability to customize the alarm label, such as \"Class Alarm\" or \"Study Session,\" to better organize her day. She occasionally asks the assistant to set additional one-time alarms for important deadlines or appointments, appreciating the flexibility to adjust alarm times as needed.\n\nThe user values the assistant's ability to provide confirmations and reminders about her scheduled alarms, especially during exam periods when her routine may fluctuate. She has also inquired about the possibility of integrating her alarms with her calendar or to-do list, aiming to streamline her time management.\n\nWhile the user primarily relies on the alarm assistant for her academic schedule, she has occasionally requested weekend alarms for personal commitments or leisure activities. In these instances, she prefers later alarm times and has experimented with different alarm tones, such as gentle melodies or nature sounds.\n\nThroughout their interactions, the user has provided feedback on the assistant's clarity and responsiveness, appreciating the ability to set alarms efficiently and receive timely reminders. She has also expressed interest in exploring additional features like alarm snooze functionality or the ability to set recurring alarms for specific date ranges, further enhancing the assistant's capabilities to meet her evolving needs.",
