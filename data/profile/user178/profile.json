She prefers a gentle nature sound to wake up at 6:30 AM sharp on weekdays.\n\nIn their initial interactions, the user asked the assistant to set a recurring alarm for weekdays at 6:30 AM with a nature sound option. She provided feedback that the default alarm sounds were too jarring, leading the assistant to recommend soothing nature sounds like bird calls or ocean waves.\n\nOver time, the user started requesting additional customizations, such as increasing the alarm volume gradually or setting a back-up alarm 10 minutes after the initial one. She appreciates when the assistant sends a reminder the night before about the next day's alarm.\n\nThe user has occasionally asked the assistant to adjust her alarm time by 15-30 minutes for days when she needs to leave home earlier or has an important morning meeting. She values the assistant's ability to make these temporary changes without disrupting her regular weekday alarm routine.\n\nWhile the user primarily uses the alarm for weekday mornings, she has on occasion set weekend alarms, typically for a later wake-up time like 8 AM. She tends to disable these weekend alarms if she doesn't have specific plans.\n\nThe user's interactions are polite but concise, reflecting her busy lifestyle. She appreciates when the assistant confirms alarm details clearly and doesn't require excessive back-and-forth. Over the years, the assistant has learned her preferences well, minimizing the need for her to provide detailed instructions each time.",
