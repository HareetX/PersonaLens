She has provided positive feedback on the intuitive interface and the option to set multiple alarms with different tones for varied purposes, like weekends or travel.\n\nIn addition to her regular weekday alarm, the user has occasionally requested one-time alarms for specific dates, such as reminders for social events or deadlines. She values the assistant's proactive suggestions for optimal alarm times based on her schedule and sleep patterns.\n\nThe user has expressed interest in exploring features like gradually increasing alarm volume and integrating with smart home devices to control lights or temperature upon waking up.
