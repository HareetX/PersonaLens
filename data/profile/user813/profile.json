He prefers to have a recurring alarm set for 7:00 AM on weekdays, with a gradual increase in volume to gently wake him up.\n\nIn the initial interactions, the user requested a simple weekday alarm to be set for 7:00 AM with a standard alarm tone. Over time, he provided feedback that the abrupt sound was too jarring and asked for recommendations on more pleasant alarm sounds. The assistant suggested a few nature-inspired tones that gradually increase in volume, and the user settled on a gentle ocean wave sound.\n\nThe user has expressed appreciation for the assistant's ability to remember his alarm preferences, eliminating the need to specify the details each time. He occasionally checks in to confirm the alarm is still set correctly or to make temporary adjustments when his schedule changes.\n\nIn addition to the weekday alarm, the user has requested one-off alarms for specific dates and times, such as for early morning flights or important meetings. He values the assistant's flexibility in accommodating these ad-hoc requests while maintaining his preferred recurring alarm settings.\n\nThe user's interactions with the assistant have been straightforward and efficient, reflecting his practical approach to alarm management. He appreciates the assistant's ability to understand and execute his preferences accurately, without the need for excessive conversation or prompting.",
