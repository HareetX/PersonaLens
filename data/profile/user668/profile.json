        "Alarm": "The user, a 25-34 year old unemployed American male with a bachelor's degree, frequently interacts with the alarm assistant to manage his weekday morning routine. His preferred alarm time is set for 9:00 AM, allowing him to wake up and start his day at a reasonable hour while job searching.\n\nInitially, the user requested a simple, recurring weekday alarm with an upbeat musical tone to help him wake up feeling energized and motivated. Over time, he began experimenting with different alarm sounds, ranging from classic rock to synthwave tracks, to find the perfect blend of familiarity and novelty to kickstart his mornings.\n\nThe user appreciates the assistant's ability to provide seamless alarm management, allowing him to easily adjust settings or temporarily disable alarms when needed.
