Past interactions show a consistent preference for setting a recurring alarm at 7:30 AM on weekdays, with a gentle nature sound to ease her into the day.\n\nIn one instance, the user requested a temporary adjustment to her alarm time for an early morning flight, asking the assistant to set a one-time alarm for 5:00 AM with a slightly more energetic sound. She later provided positive feedback on the assistant's ability to handle such specific requests seamlessly.\n\nOver time, the user has expressed interest in exploring additional features, such as integrating the alarm with her calendar events or setting location-based alarms for important meetings or appointments. She has also inquired about the possibility of customizing the alarm sound, suggesting the incorporation of soothing rainfall or ocean wave sounds.\n\nThe user appreciates the assistant's straightforward and efficient approach to setting and managing alarms. She values clear confirmations and the ability to easily review or modify her existing alarm settings. Additionally, she has requested the option to set recurring alarms for weekends with a later wake-up time, indicating a desire for flexibility based on her schedule.\n\nWhile the user's interactions have primarily focused on the core alarm functionality, she has shown an openness to exploring additional features that could enhance her overall experience and better align with her lifestyle and preferences.",
