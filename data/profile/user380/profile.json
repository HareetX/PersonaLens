As a part-time worker, he values the ability to set consistent alarms that align with his schedule.\n\nIn past interactions, the user has expressed a preference for a gradual increase in alarm sound volume, finding it a more pleasant way to wake up compared to jarring, abrupt noises. He has requested the alarm to be set for 9:00 AM on weekdays, allowing him ample time to get ready for work or other commitments.\n\nOver time, the user has provided feedback on the alarm tones, favoring natural sounds like bird calls or gentle instrumental music. He has also asked the assistant to set recurring alarms for specific days of the week, such as Mondays and Wednesdays, when he has early morning shifts.\n\nThe user appreciates the assistant's ability to confirm alarm settings and provide reminders the night before, ensuring he doesn't oversleep. He has occasionally requested temporary adjustments to his alarm times, such as setting it an hour earlier for important appointments or meetings.\n\nIn addition to setting alarms, the user has inquired about features like snooze functionality and the ability to customize alarm labels or descriptions. He has expressed an interest in exploring integrations that could automate certain tasks, like turning on smart lights or brewing coffee, in conjunction with his morning alarm.\n\nOverall, the user values the assistant's reliability and ease of use in managing his weekday alarm routine. He appreciates the personalized experience and has shown a willingness to explore additional features that could further streamline his morning preparations.",
