She prefers to set a recurring gentle nature sound alarm for 7:30 AM on weekdays to wake up for work.\n\nIn initial interactions, the user requested guidance on setting up her preferred alarm sound and time. Over time, she has grown accustomed to simply asking the assistant to \"set my weekday alarm\" without needing to specify the details each time.\n\nThe user occasionally adjusts her alarm time slightly earlier or later based on her work schedule for the week. She appreciates the assistant's ability to confirm the updated alarm details clearly.\n\nOn certain occasions, such as holidays or weekends, the user proactively asks the assistant to disable her weekday alarm to allow for sleeping in. She has also requested one-off early morning alarms for important appointments or travel days.\n\nThe user maintains a polite and straightforward interaction style, favoring a concise and efficient experience when managing her alarms. She has provided positive feedback on the reliability and customizability of the alarm assistant, which aligns well with her morning routine preferences as a working professional.",
