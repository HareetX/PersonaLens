        "Alarm": "The user, a 35-44 year old male from the United Kingdom working full-time, frequently interacts with the virtual assistant to manage his morning alarms. He prefers to set a recurring weekday alarm for 7:00 AM to ensure he wakes up on time for work. \n\nInitially, the user requested a simple alarm tone, but over time he has grown to prefer an upbeat music track to help energize his mornings. He has provided positive feedback when the assistant recommends lively, motivating songs from his preferred music streaming service.\n\nThe user values consistency and reliability in the alarm functionality. He has expressed frustration when alarms fail to go off or are not loud enough to wake him up. As a result, he frequently asks the assistant to confirm and test his alarm settings.\n\nOver time, the user has requested additional features like the ability to snooze the alarm for short periods and to have the assistant provide weather and traffic updates when the alarm goes off. He appreciates a casual, friendly tone from the assistant in the mornings.\n\nOn weekends, the user occasionally sets ad-hoc alarms for later in the day, usually requesting mellower music or natural sounds like bird songs or ocean waves. He has also explored the option of setting multiple alarms on weekends with incrementally louder volumes to ensure he doesn't oversleep.\n\nOverall, the user values an alarm experience that is reliable, customizable, and integrated with his daily routine. He responds well to the assistant's ability to learn and adapt to his evolving preferences while maintaining a consistent and user-friendly interface for alarm management.",
