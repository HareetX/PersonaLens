His preferred alarm time is set for 7:30 AM, allowing him enough time to get ready for work without feeling rushed.\n\nEarly interactions involved setting up a recurring weekday alarm with a gentle nature sound, as the user prefers a calming start to his day. He has provided feedback that harsh or jarring alarm tones leave him feeling stressed and groggy.\n\nOver time, the user has requested the ability to customize the alarm sound further, asking for a rotation of soothing nature sounds like birds chirping, ocean waves, or light rainfall.
