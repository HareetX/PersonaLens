Past interactions indicate a preference for a gentle, nature-inspired alarm sound set for 9:30 AM on weekdays.\n\nInitially, the user requested assistance in setting a recurring weekday alarm with a soothing bird song sound to wake up gradually. They expressed appreciation for the alarm's calming effect, which helped them start their day in a relaxed manner.
