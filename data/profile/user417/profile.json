The user appreciates the assistant's ability to set recurring alarms with a single command, eliminating the need for daily adjustments.\n\nIn one instance, the user requested a temporary adjustment to her alarm time to accommodate a job interview, asking the assistant to set a one-time alarm for 7:30 AM the following day. On another occasion, she sought guidance on setting multiple alarms for different purposes, such as a morning alarm for job search activities and an afternoon reminder for household chores.\n\nOver time, the user has expressed interest in exploring additional alarm features, such as gradually increasing volume or integrating with her calendar for event-based alarms. She has also inquired about the possibility of customizing alarm sounds, suggesting the incorporation of soothing instrumental music or nature recordings.\n\nThe user values clear and concise confirmations from the assistant when setting or modifying alarms. She appreciates a friendly and supportive tone, as the assistant's reminders play a role in structuring her daily routine during this transitional phase of seeking employment.",
