        "Alarm": "The user, a young professional woman in her late 20s from the United States, frequently interacts with the alarm assistant to manage her weekday schedule. As a native English speaker with a graduate degree, she values efficiency and customization in her interactions.\n\nOne of her primary requests is setting a recurring weekday alarm for 7:30 AM, with a gradual increase in volume to gently wake her up. She has expressed a preference for this alarm sound over abrupt or jarring tones, as it aligns with her morning routine.\n\nOver time, the user has fine-tuned her alarm preferences, occasionally adjusting the time by a few minutes or requesting a temporary change for specific days. For instance, she might ask the assistant to set the alarm for 8:00 AM on a Friday or move it to 7:00 AM for an early meeting.\n\nThe user appreciates the assistant's ability to confirm and summarize her alarm settings, ensuring accuracy.
