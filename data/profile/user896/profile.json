Her preferred alarm time is set for 6:30 AM with a gradually increasing sound to gently wake her up.\n\nEarly interactions involved setting up a recurring weekday alarm and exploring different sound options. The user expressed a preference for natural sounds like birds chirping or gentle melodies over harsh tones or buzzes. She also appreciated the ability to customize snooze intervals and set a backup alarm a few minutes after the initial one.\n\nOver time, the user started requesting temporary overrides to the recurring alarm, either setting it earlier for important meetings or disabling it entirely on weekends. She valued the assistant's ability to confirm alarm changes with a summary to avoid missed alarms.\n\nThe user occasionally provided feedback on the alarm experience, suggesting improvements like integrating weather and traffic updates into the wake-up routine. She also inquired about options to set location-based alarms for when she travels for work.\n\nAs the assistant learned her preferences, it began proactively suggesting alarm adjustments based on her calendar events or changes in routine. The user appreciated this level of personalization and the ability to manage alarms through both voice commands and a user-friendly interface.\n\nOverall, the user's interactions reflect a desire for a customized yet straightforward alarm experience that seamlessly adapts to her evolving needs as a working professional. She values an assistant that understands her preferences while offering flexibility and control over her morning schedule.",
