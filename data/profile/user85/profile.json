        "Alarm": "The user, a university student aged 18-24 from Belgium, frequently interacts with the alarm assistant to manage her weekday schedule. With a preference for upbeat music as her alarm sound, she typically sets a recurring alarm for 7:30 AM on weekdays to ensure she wakes up on time for classes.\n\nIn the past, the user has requested the assistant to adjust the alarm time slightly earlier or later based on her class schedule for the day. She has also asked for recommendations on energizing alarm tones to help her start the day feeling motivated.\n\nOver time, the user has expressed a desire for more personalized alarm settings, such as gradually increasing the volume or incorporating motivational quotes or affirmations into the alarm experience. She has also inquired about the possibility of integrating her alarm with other smart home devices, such as slowly turning on the lights or adjusting the thermostat when the alarm goes off.\n\nThe user appreciates the assistant's ability to provide reminders and confirmations for her alarm settings, ensuring she doesn't accidentally oversleep or miss important commitments. She has also provided feedback on the user interface, suggesting improvements for easier navigation and customization options.\n\nAs the user's schedule evolves with internships or extracurricular activities, she may request temporary adjustments to her alarm settings or explore options for location-based alarms to accommodate her changing routines.
