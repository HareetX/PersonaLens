She prefers to set a recurring alarm for 6:30 AM on weekdays, allowing her ample time to get ready for work.\n\nIn her initial interactions, the user requested a gentle nature sound as her alarm tone, finding harsh beeps or buzzes too jarring to wake up to. She has expressed appreciation for the soothing bird calls or flowing stream sounds offered by the assistant.\n\nOver time, the user has developed a habit of checking in with the assistant the night before to confirm her 6:30 AM weekday alarm is set properly. She occasionally asks the assistant to adjust the alarm time by 15-30 minutes if she anticipates a busy morning or has an early appointment.\n\nThe user values the assistant's ability to provide clear verbal confirmations of her alarm settings. She has provided feedback that the confirmations help put her mind at ease before going to sleep, ensuring she won't oversleep.\n\nOn weekends, the user rarely sets an alarm unless she has specific plans. However, she has asked the assistant a few times to set a one-time 8:00 AM alarm for Saturday mornings when expecting out-of-town visitors or attending an event.\n\nThe user's interactions with the alarm assistant reflect her desire for a consistent weekday routine while allowing flexibility for leisure on weekends. She appreciates the straightforward functionality and the calming nature sounds that gently ease her into her day.",
