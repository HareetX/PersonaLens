She prefers to set a recurring alarm for 6:30 AM on weekdays, allowing enough time to get ready for work without rushing.\n\nIn past interactions, the user has expressed a strong preference for gentle, nature-inspired alarm sounds, finding them soothing and less jarring to wake up to. She has experimented with various sounds like bird songs, ocean waves, and forest ambience before settling on a favorite gentle rainfall sound.\n\nThe user values consistency and reliability in the alarm assistant. She appreciates the ability to set recurring alarms with just a few taps, eliminating the need to manually set the alarm every night. However, she occasionally requests temporary adjustments, such as setting the alarm 30 minutes earlier or later to accommodate appointments or changes in her schedule.\n\nOver time, the user has provided feedback on the assistant's alarm interface, suggesting improvements like the ability to label alarms for different purposes (e.g., \"Work Day,\" \"Weekend\") and the option to set multiple alarms with varying sounds and volumes.\n\nWhile she primarily uses the alarm for weekday mornings, the user has also explored setting occasional weekend alarms, though with a later wake-up time and more relaxing sounds like gentle piano or bird melodies. She appreciates the assistant's ability to remember her preferences and provide personalized recommendations based on her past interactions.",
        "Books": "The user, a 35-44 year old married woman from the United Kingdom, is an avid reader with a particular interest in thriller, fiction, and biography genres.

She has frequently engaged the assistant in discussions about their novels, such as \"Gone Girl,\" \"The Girl on the Train,\" and \"Big Little Lies,\" analyzing the intricate plot twists and character development. The user has also expressed a keen interest in the \"The Silent Patient\" series, often requesting updates on new releases or related book recommendations.\n\nOver time, the user has developed a preference for physical books, though she occasionally explores ebooks for convenience. She typically prefers to read in the evenings, making it a weekly ritual to unwind after work.
