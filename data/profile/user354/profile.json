        "Alarm": "The user, a 25-34 year old married male from Mexico working full-time, frequently interacts with the alarm assistant to manage his weekday morning schedule. Past interactions show a consistent pattern of setting a recurring alarm for 7:00 AM on weekdays, with a preference for a gradual increase in alarm sound volume.\n\nInitially, the user requested a simple weekday alarm with a standard tone, but over time, he has explored different alarm sound options. He has expressed a liking for nature sounds like birds chirping or ocean waves, finding them a more pleasant way to start his day compared to jarring tones.\n\nThe user values the ability to adjust alarm settings with ease, often requesting changes to the alarm time or sound based on his schedule. For instance, during particularly busy work periods, he has asked for the alarm to be set earlier, around 6:30 AM.\n\nOn weekends, the user tends to disable the recurring alarm, preferring to wake up naturally or set a one-time alarm for later in the morning if he has plans.
