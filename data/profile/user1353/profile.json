She has provided feedback on the clarity and volume of the alarm sounds, leading to adjustments to better suit her preferences.\n\nWhile the user primarily relies on the assistant for her weekday morning alarms, she has occasionally explored setting weekend alarms with different tones or times, reflecting her desire for a more relaxed schedule on her days off.\n\nThroughout the interactions, the user has maintained a polite and straightforward communication style, appreciating the assistant's ability to understand and execute her alarm-related requests efficiently and accurately.",
