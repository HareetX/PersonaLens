He prefers to have a recurring alarm set for 6:30 AM on weekdays, with the alarm sound gradually increasing in volume to gently wake him up.\n\nIn past interactions, the user has asked the assistant to set his weekday morning alarm, occasionally adjusting the time by 15-30 minutes based on his schedule. He has expressed appreciation for the gradual increase in alarm sound, finding it a more pleasant way to start his day compared to jarring sounds.\n\nOver time, the user has requested additional features, such as the ability to snooze the alarm for a customizable duration (e.g., 10 minutes) and the option to have a backup alarm set a few minutes after the primary one, ensuring he doesn't oversleep on important days.\n\nThe user has also asked for the ability to temporarily disable the weekday alarm for specific dates, such as during vacations or holidays, without having to delete and recreate the recurring alarm. He values the convenience of managing his alarms through voice commands and appreciates the assistant's ability to confirm and summarize his alarm settings.\n\nAdditionally, the user has inquired about the possibility of integrating his alarm with other smart home devices, such as gradually turning on lights or adjusting the thermostat temperature in coordination with the alarm time. He has expressed interest in exploring these advanced features to enhance his morning routine further.",
