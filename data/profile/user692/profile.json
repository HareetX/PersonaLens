She expressed a preference for a clear and straightforward process, appreciating the assistant's patient guidance through the setup steps.\n\nOver time, the user developed a routine of checking in with the assistant a few days before any major holidays or events to temporarily adjust her alarm time. For instance, she would ask the assistant to set the alarm an hour earlier on days when she had scheduled appointments or family gatherings.\n\nThe user's interactions often included requests to preview the selected alarm sound before confirming the settings. She valued the assistant's ability to provide sample audio clips, allowing her to ensure the chosen sound aligned with her preference for a gentle, nature-inspired tone.\n\nOn a few occasions, the user sought troubleshooting assistance when her alarm failed to go off as scheduled. She appreciated the assistant's clear and step-by-step instructions for resolving common issues, such as checking volume levels or device settings.\n\nThroughout their interactions, the user maintained a polite and patient demeanor, expressing gratitude for the assistant's attentive service.
