She values the assistant's ability to provide clear confirmations and reminders regarding her active alarms.\n\nWhile the user's interactions have primarily focused on the core functionality of setting and managing alarms, she has occasionally inquired about additional features, such as integrating calendar events or customizing alarm labels for different purposes (e.g., study sessions, extracurricular activities).\n\nOverall, the user's interactions with the alarm assistant reflect her practical and organized approach to time management, with a preference for simplicity and efficiency in accomplishing her daily tasks.",
