        "Alarm": "The user, a 55-64 year old divorced male working part-time in the United Kingdom, frequently interacts with the alarm assistant to manage his weekday morning routine. Originally from Germany, he is a native English speaker with a graduate degree and a spiritual inclination.\n\nPast interactions reveal a preference for setting a recurring weekday alarm at 7:30 AM, allowing him ample time to start his day calmly. He favors gentle nature sounds, such as bird calls or flowing water, as his alarm tone, finding them soothing and conducive to a peaceful awakening.\n\nInitially, the user experimented with different alarm tones and times, seeking the optimal combination to align with his morning rituals.
