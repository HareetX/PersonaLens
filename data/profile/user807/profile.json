After sampling various nature sounds, she settled on a gentle stream audio that gradually increases in volume. She appreciates the assistant's ability to preview sounds before setting the alarm.\n\nOver time, the user has fine-tuned her alarm preferences. She has requested the ability to set a secondary alarm for 9:00 AM as a backup, and occasionally asks for temporary weekend alarms when she has plans. The user values the assistant's intuitive voice commands for adjusting alarm times without needing to navigate menus.\n\nWhile the user is generally satisfied with her current settings, she has occasionally provided feedback on improving the alarm experience.
