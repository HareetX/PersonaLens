However, she typically reverts to her preferred 7:00 AM wake-up call after a few days.\n\nThe user values the assistant's ability to confirm alarm settings clearly and provide reminders the night before, ensuring she doesn't oversleep. She has also requested the assistant to suggest alternative nature sounds for her alarm, leading to her current preference for a gentle stream sound.\n\nWhile the user's alarm preferences have remained relatively stable, she has occasionally expressed interest in exploring features like gradually increasing alarm volumes or integrating with smart home devices to automate her morning routine further.
