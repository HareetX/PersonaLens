She prefers a gentle nature sound to wake up at 7:30 AM on weekdays, allowing her enough time to get ready for work.\n\nIn the initial interactions, the user set up a recurring weekday alarm with the preferred sound and time. She appreciated the assistant's ability to confirm the alarm details and provide a summary of the upcoming alarms for the week.\n\nOver time, the user started requesting the assistant to snooze or adjust her alarm timing based on her schedule changes. For instance, if she had an early morning appointment, she would ask the assistant to set the alarm 30 minutes earlier than usual.\n\nThe user also experimented with different nature sounds for her alarm, seeking a soothing yet effective way to start her day. She provided feedback on the sounds, indicating her preferences for bird songs or gentle rainfall over more abrupt sounds like wind chimes.\n\nAdditionally, the user occasionally asked the assistant to set weekend alarms for specific events or appointments, deviating from her typical weekday routine. In these cases, she would specify the desired time and sound, appreciating the assistant's ability to accommodate her ad-hoc requests.\n\nOver the years, the user developed a comfortable rapport with the assistant, often expressing gratitude for the reliable alarm management and the ability to customize her wake-up experience. She valued the assistant's consistent performance and the ease of adjusting her alarm settings as her schedule evolved.",
