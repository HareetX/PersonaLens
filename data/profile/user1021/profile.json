As a native English speaker of Middle Eastern/Arab ethnicity and Muslim faith, he prefers a gentle, nature-inspired alarm sound to wake up at 7:00 AM on weekdays.\n\nIn past interactions, the user has requested the assistant to set a recurring weekday alarm for 7:00 AM with a soothing nature sound, such as bird calls or ocean waves. He has expressed a preference for waking up gradually, without jarring sounds that could cause stress or disrupt his sleep cycle.\n\nOver time, the user has provided feedback on the alarm tones, occasionally asking to adjust the volume or switch to a different nature sound, like a gentle rainstorm or forest ambiance. He has also requested the assistant to remind him about the upcoming alarm the night before, helping him establish a consistent sleep routine.\n\nDuring periods of job searching or interviews, the user has temporarily adjusted his alarm time to accommodate his schedule changes. He has asked the assistant to set one-time alarms for earlier or later times, depending on his commitments for the day.\n\nThe user values the assistant's ability to understand and adapt to his preferences, ensuring a peaceful and gradual wake-up experience. He has appreciated the assistant's reminders and flexibility in adjusting alarm settings, which has helped him maintain a balanced routine during his job search and personal life.",
