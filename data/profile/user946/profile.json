She prefers to have a gentle nature sound alarm set for 7:30 AM on weekdays to help her start her day in a calm and relaxed manner.\n\nIn their interactions, the user has expressed appreciation for the assistant's ability to set recurring alarms tailored to her preferences. She has provided feedback on the alarm sounds, favoring soothing nature sounds over harsh tones or music. The user has also requested the assistant to adjust the alarm volume to a moderate level, ensuring it wakes her up without being too jarring.\n\nOver time, the user has asked the assistant to modify the alarm time slightly earlier or later based on her schedule changes. She has also inquired about setting temporary one-off alarms for weekends or special occasions when her routine differs.\n\nThe user values the assistant's ability to remember her preferences and make adjustments accordingly. She appreciates the clear and concise confirmation messages after setting or modifying an alarm. Additionally, she has requested the assistant to provide reminders a few minutes before the alarm goes off, allowing her to wake up gradually.\n\nWhile the user's primary focus has been on managing her weekday morning alarms, she has occasionally explored other alarm-related features, such as setting reminders for important tasks or appointments. However, her interactions have consistently centered around optimizing her morning routine with a gentle and consistent alarm experience.",
