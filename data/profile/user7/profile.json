As a native English speaker with a Jewish background, she prefers a friendly and straightforward interaction style.\n\nOne of the recurring themes in her interactions is setting a weekday alarm for 8:00 AM, which aligns with her class schedule. She has expressed a preference for upbeat music as her alarm sound, often requesting recommendations for energizing tunes to start her day. The assistant has suggested various pop and rock playlists, which she has consistently enjoyed.\n\nOver time, the user has developed a habit of asking the assistant to set her alarm the night before, occasionally requesting a reminder to do so if she forgets. She also appreciates the ability to snooze or dismiss the alarm with simple voice commands, which has become a part of her morning routine.\n\nDuring exam periods or when her schedule changes, the user has requested temporary adjustments to her alarm time, sometimes setting multiple alarms or asking for reminders to study or complete assignments. She has also inquired about setting recurring alarms for weekends, though she typically prefers to sleep in on those days.\n\nThe user has provided feedback on the assistant's alarm functionality, suggesting improvements such as the ability to set alarms with specific music or integrating with her calendar for automatic alarm adjustments. She values the assistant's ability to understand and adapt to her preferences, and she appreciates the occasional check-in to ensure her alarm settings remain optimal.",
