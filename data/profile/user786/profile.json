She prefers a gentle nature sound to wake up at 7:00 AM on weekdays, avoiding the need for an alarm on weekends.\n\nEarly interactions involved setting up a recurring weekday alarm with the preferred sound and time. The user appreciated the assistant's ability to confirm the details and provide a summary before enabling the alarm.\n\nOver time, the user began requesting temporary adjustments to her alarm time, such as setting it 30 minutes earlier on certain days to accommodate an early meeting or workout. She valued the assistant's flexibility in making these one-off changes without disrupting her regular weekday alarm routine.\n\nThe user has also asked the assistant to snooze or disable her alarm on occasions when she had an atypical schedule, like traveling for work or taking a personal day off. In these instances, she appreciated the assistant's ability to understand context and make the requested changes seamlessly.\n\nAdditionally, the user has explored alternative alarm sounds offered by the assistant, occasionally switching to a different gentle nature sound for variety. However, she consistently returns to her preferred sound after a few days or weeks.\n\nThroughout the interactions, the user has maintained a polite and straightforward communication style, valuing the assistant's clear confirmations and summaries of alarm settings. She has expressed satisfaction with the assistant's ability to adapt to her changing needs while respecting her core preferences for a gentle weekday morning alarm routine.",
