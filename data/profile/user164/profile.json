She has expressed a preference for contemporary pop or electronic dance music tracks, often asking the assistant to curate a rotating playlist of her favorite artists and genres.\n\nThe user values the ability to easily snooze or dismiss the alarm with simple voice commands, as she sometimes struggles to wake up in the morning. She has also requested the assistant to provide gentle reminders about upcoming assignments or exams when setting the alarm, helping her stay organized and on top of her academic responsibilities.\n\nOver time, the user has explored additional features like setting multiple alarms for different purposes, such as a separate alarm for weekend mornings when she prefers to sleep in. She has also experimented with adjusting the alarm volume and gradually increasing the music volume for a more gentle wake-up experience.\n\nThe user appreciates the assistant's friendly and supportive tone, often engaging in light-hearted banter or seeking encouragement when facing a particularly challenging week.
