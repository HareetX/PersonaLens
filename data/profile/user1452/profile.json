Past interactions reveal a preference for a gentle nature sound alarm set for 6:30 AM on weekdays, aligning with her routine.\n\nInitially, the user requested a simple weekday alarm setup, but over time, she began exploring more customization options. She asked the assistant to set different alarm tones for weekends, opting for a more energetic sound to help her start her days off right. Additionally, she requested the ability to temporarily disable alarms for specific dates, such as holidays or vacation days.\n\nThe user appreciates the assistant's ability to provide reminders and confirmations for her alarm settings, ensuring she doesn't accidentally oversleep or miss important appointments. She has also inquired about the possibility of setting location-based alarms, which could adjust her wake-up time based on her commute or travel schedule.\n\nThroughout their interactions, the user has maintained a polite and professional demeanor, expressing gratitude for the assistant's reliability and responsiveness. She has occasionally provided feedback on the alarm sounds, suggesting the incorporation of more nature-inspired options or the ability to upload personalized tones.\n\nAs her trust in the assistant grew, the user began exploring additional features, such as integrating her alarms with her calendar events or setting recurring alarms for specific tasks or routines. She has also shown interest in the potential for the assistant to learn her preferences over time, automatically adjusting alarm settings based on her patterns and habits.",
