Past interactions show a preference for setting a recurring alarm for 6:30 AM on weekdays, allowing him to wake up early for his full-time job.\n\nInitially, the user requested a gentle nature sound as the alarm tone, finding it soothing and less jarring than traditional alarm sounds. Over time, he has experimented with different nature sounds like bird calls, ocean waves, and forest ambiance, providing feedback on his preferences.\n\nThe user appreciates the assistant's ability to set alarms quickly with minimal input, often using voice commands or brief text instructions. He has occasionally asked for temporary adjustments to his alarm time, such as setting it 15 minutes earlier or later on specific days.\n\nIn addition to managing his morning alarm, the user has also requested occasional reminders or one-time alarms for important events or appointments. These alarms are typically set a few hours in advance, with a more assertive tone to ensure he doesn't miss them.\n\nThe user values consistency and reliability in his alarm management, expressing frustration if an alarm fails to go off as scheduled. He has provided positive feedback when the assistant proactively confirms alarm settings or reminds him of upcoming alarms.\n\nOver the years, the user's interaction style has remained direct and concise, preferring straightforward commands and responses. He appreciates the assistant's ability to understand and execute his alarm-related requests efficiently, without unnecessary prompts or complications.",
