She values the assistant's flexibility in accommodating these one-off changes while maintaining her preferred gentle nature sound.\n\nAdditionally, the user has expressed interest in exploring the assistant's capabilities to set multiple alarms with different tones, potentially for different purposes like reminding her to take medication or pick up her children from school.
