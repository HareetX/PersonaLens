She often provided feedback on the effectiveness of various alarm sounds, expressing a desire for something that would motivate her to get out of bed without being too jarring.\n\nOver time, the user has developed a habit of confirming her alarm settings with the assistant the night before, ensuring that the alarm is properly set for the following morning. She has also requested occasional reminders from the assistant to adjust her alarm times during school breaks or holidays, demonstrating her adaptability to changing schedules.\n\nIn addition to setting alarms, the user has inquired about features that could enhance her morning routine, such as integrating weather updates or news briefings to be delivered alongside the alarm. She has expressed interest in exploring customizable alarm sequences, where multiple alarms could be set in succession to gradually ease her into the day.\n\nThe user's interactions with the assistant have been polite and direct, reflecting her advanced English proficiency.
