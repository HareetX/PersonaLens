        "Alarm": "The user, a 35-44 year old stay-at-home parent originally from Russia but now residing in the UK, frequently interacts with the assistant to manage her weekday morning alarms. With a preference for gentle nature sounds, she has the assistant set a recurring alarm for 8:30 AM from Monday to Friday.\n\nOver time, the user has provided feedback on the alarm tones, requesting softer and more soothing nature sounds like bird calls or flowing streams. She appreciates the ability to preview alarm sounds before setting them.\n\nOn occasion, the user asks the assistant to adjust the alarm time slightly earlier or later based on her schedule for the day. She values the flexibility to make temporary changes without disrupting her regular weekday routine.\n\nThe user has also explored options for setting multiple alarms with different tones, such as a backup alarm a few minutes after the initial one. However, she often reverts to her preferred single alarm setup to avoid overwhelming herself in the mornings.\n\nWhile satisfied with the core alarm functionality, the user has inquired about additional features like alarm integration with calendar events or location-based alarms for when she is traveling. She has expressed interest in customizable alarm profiles that could automatically adjust settings based on her day's activities.\n\nThe user's interactions are typically straightforward, focusing on setting, checking, and modifying alarms. She appreciates clear confirmations and occasional reminders about her current alarm settings. Overall, her engagement reflects a desire for a simple yet adaptable alarm experience tailored to her morning preferences as a stay-at-home parent.",
