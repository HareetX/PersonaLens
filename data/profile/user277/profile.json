The user typically sets his alarm for 8:30 AM, allowing him enough time to get ready and commute to campus.\n\nInitially, the user struggled with consistently adhering to his alarm routine, sometimes oversleeping or dismissing the alarm too quickly. Over time, he requested features like snooze customization and gradually increasing alarm volumes to help him wake up more effectively.\n\nThe user appreciates the assistant's ability to provide weather updates and traffic information alongside his morning alarms, helping him plan his commute and attire accordingly. He has also expressed interest in integrating his class schedule with the alarm system, allowing for dynamic alarm adjustments based on his timetable.\n\nDuring exam periods or project deadlines, the user often seeks assistance in setting temporary alarm adjustments, either for earlier wake-up times or weekend study sessions. He values the assistant's flexibility in accommodating his changing needs while maintaining his preferred alarm settings for regular weekdays.\n\nOverall, the user's interactions with the alarm assistant reflect a desire for convenience, personalization, and seamless integration with his student lifestyle.
