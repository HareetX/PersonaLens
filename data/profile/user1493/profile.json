He has also experimented with different nature sounds, such as bird calls or ocean waves, but often reverts to his preferred gentle nature sound.\n\nWhile the user's English proficiency is basic, he has been able to communicate his needs effectively with the assistant, occasionally seeking clarification or rephrasing when encountering language barriers. The assistant has adapted its communication style to use simpler language and provide step-by-step instructions when necessary.\n\nIn addition to setting and adjusting the alarm, the user has occasionally requested reminders about the alarm status or asked for confirmation of the alarm details. He has expressed appreciation for the assistant's patience and clear explanations, particularly when troubleshooting any issues with the alarm functionality.\n\nAs the user continues his job search, the consistent wake-up routine facilitated by the alarm has become an integral part of his daily routine, ensuring he starts his day on time and prepared for potential interviews or job-related activities.",
