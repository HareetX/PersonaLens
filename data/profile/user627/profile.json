For instance, she might ask for a slightly later alarm on certain days or a more energetic sound to help her wake up during gloomy weather.\n\nThe user values the assistant's ability to remember her preferences and make personalized recommendations, such as suggesting a relaxing nature sound for weekends or adjusting the alarm volume based on her sleep patterns. She appreciates the assistant's efficiency in managing her alarms while maintaining a friendly and helpful tone.",
