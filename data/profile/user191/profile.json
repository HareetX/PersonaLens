She prefers a gentle nature sound to wake up at 6:30 AM on weekdays, allowing her enough time to get ready for work.\n\nIn one instance, she requested the assistant to set a recurring alarm for the weekdays with the sound of a babbling brook. She expressed satisfaction with the soothing yet effective alarm, which helped her start her day feeling refreshed and energized.\n\nOver time, the user has asked the assistant to adjust the alarm time slightly earlier or later based on her changing work schedule. She appreciates the assistant's ability to make these modifications quickly and seamlessly.\n\nDuring holidays or weekends, the user often disables her weekday alarm through a simple voice command or the assistant's interface. She has also explored different nature sounds for her alarm, occasionally switching to bird songs or ocean waves for variety.\n\nThe user values the assistant's intuitive alarm management capabilities and the ability to customize her wake-up experience. She has provided positive feedback on the assistant's responsiveness and the ease of setting, modifying, or disabling alarms as needed.\n\nWhile the user's alarm preferences have remained relatively consistent, she has shown interest in exploring additional features, such as gradually increasing alarm volume or integrating with her calendar for automatic alarm adjustments based on her schedule.",
