She prefers a gentle nature sound to wake up at 6:30 AM sharp on weekdays.\n\nIn her initial interactions, she set up a recurring weekday alarm with the nature sound she likes. Over time, she has occasionally asked the assistant to change the alarm time slightly earlier or later by 15-30 minutes based on her schedule that week. She appreciates the ability to make temporary adjustments without altering her default 6:30 AM weekday alarm.\n\nThe user has provided positive feedback on the natural alarm tones, mentioning they help her wake up feeling more refreshed compared to harsh, jarring sounds. She once requested recommendations for new gentle nature sounds and ended up selecting a calming forest bird audio clip.\n\nWhile traveling for work, the user has disabled her weekday alarm and instead set temporary one-off alarms for different days and times based on her trip itinerary. Upon returning home, she reactivates her recurring weekday alarm setup.\n\nThe user's interactions demonstrate a preference for an efficient alarm management experience tailored to her schedule. She values the ability to customize alarm sounds and times while relying on a consistent default setting for her regular weekday routine. Her polite and succinct communication style reflects her busy lifestyle.",
