He has also asked for integration with his calendar, allowing the assistant to automatically adjust alarm times based on his schedule.\n\nThe user values the assistant's ability to understand and adapt to his preferences, often providing feedback on the alarm experience. He has occasionally requested temporary changes to his alarm settings, such as setting an earlier wake-up time for important meetings or appointments.\n\nNotably, the user has expressed interest in exploring sleep tracking features, seeking insights into his sleep patterns and quality. He has inquired about the assistant's capabilities in providing personalized sleep recommendations based on his data.\n\nOverall, the user appreciates the assistant's intuitive interface and responsiveness to his needs.
