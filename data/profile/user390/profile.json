She prefers to set a recurring gentle nature sound alarm for 6:30 AM on weekdays to wake up for work.\n\nIn her initial interactions, the user asked the assistant to set a recurring weekday alarm with a nature sound like birds chirping or a gentle stream. She expressed a preference for waking up gradually to natural sounds rather than jarring tones.\n\nOver time, the user has occasionally asked the assistant to change the alarm time slightly earlier or later by 15-30 minutes based on her schedule. She has also requested snooze functionality, allowing her to briefly postpone the alarm on some mornings.\n\nThe user appreciates the assistant's ability to confirm her alarm settings and provide reminders the night before. She has given positive feedback on the natural alarm sounds, noting they help her start her day feeling refreshed.\n\nIn some instances, the user has asked the assistant to set temporary one-time alarms for weekend mornings, typically an hour later than her weekday alarm. She also requested the ability to label alarms, such as \"Work Alarm\" or \"Weekend Alarm,\" for easier identification.\n\nThe user's interactions with the assistant reflect her desire for a consistent yet flexible morning routine. She values the natural alarm sounds and the assistant's ability to adapt to her changing schedules while maintaining her preferred weekday wake-up time.",
