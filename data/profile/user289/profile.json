She prefers a gentle nature sound to wake up at 7:30 AM on weekdays, aligning with her class schedule.\n\nInitially, the user requested a simple recurring weekday alarm at 7:30 AM with a nature sound. Over time, she started asking for additional functionality, such as the ability to set multiple alarms with different sounds for varying purposes (e.g., a more energetic sound for workout days).\n\nThe user appreciates the assistant's ability to understand and set complex alarm patterns, like setting an earlier alarm on days she has an early class or a later alarm during exam periods when her schedule is more flexible. She has also requested the ability to temporarily disable alarms for weekends or holidays without losing her regular settings.\n\nIn addition to setting alarms, the user occasionally asks the assistant to provide weather updates for her morning commute or to recommend peaceful nature sounds for better sleep quality. She values the assistant's clear and concise responses, preferring a straightforward interaction style without excessive verbosity.\n\nAs the user's trust in the assistant grew, she started exploring more advanced features, such as integrating her calendar events to automatically adjust alarm times or setting location-based alarms for when she travels. She has also expressed interest in customizing alarm sounds based on her mood or daily goals, further personalizing her morning routine with the assistant's help.",
