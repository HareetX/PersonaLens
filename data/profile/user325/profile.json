She has experimented with various nature sounds like bird songs, ocean waves, and rainforest ambiance before settling on a particular favorite \u2013 the sound of a gentle stream.\n\nOver time, the user has provided feedback on the alarm volume, requesting it to start softly and gradually increase in volume to allow for a gentle wake-up experience. She has also asked the assistant to provide a brief weather forecast and traffic update immediately after dismissing the alarm, to help plan her morning commute.\n\nThe user appreciates the assistant's ability to understand and remember her preferences, eliminating the need to repeatedly set up the alarm details. She has occasionally requested one-off alarms for weekend appointments or reminders, but her primary use case remains the recurring weekday morning alarm.\n\nIn addition to setting alarms, the user has sought the assistant's guidance on developing better sleep habits and morning routines. She has inquired about recommended sleep durations, bedtime routines, and tips for waking up feeling refreshed and energized.\n\nThe user's interactions with the alarm assistant are characterized by a friendly and appreciative tone.
