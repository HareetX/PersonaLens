They prefer to set a recurring weekday alarm for 8:00 AM, with an upbeat music track as the alarm sound to help them start their day energized.\n\nIn the past, the user has requested the assistant to set alarms for specific dates, such as exam days or important deadlines, adjusting the time and sound preferences accordingly. They have also asked the assistant to modify existing alarms, either changing the time or switching to a different upbeat song from their preferred playlist.\n\nOver time, the user has developed a habit of checking in with the assistant the night before to confirm their alarm settings for the next day. They often provide feedback on the effectiveness of different alarm sounds, expressing a preference for more energetic tracks that gradually increase in volume.\n\nThe user appreciates the assistant's ability to understand and remember their preferences, eliminating the need to specify details repeatedly. They have also inquired about the possibility of setting location-based alarms, which could adjust the alarm time based on their proximity to the university campus.\n\nAdditionally, the user has shown interest in exploring features that integrate their alarm routine with other smart home devices, such as automatically turning on lights or adjusting the thermostat when the alarm goes off. They value the assistant's ability to provide personalized recommendations and adapt to their evolving needs as a busy student.",
