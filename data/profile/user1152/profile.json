She prefers setting a recurring gentle nature alarm tone for 8:30 AM on weekdays to wake up for classes and study sessions.\n\nIn the past, the user has requested the assistant to adjust the alarm volume based on her sleep patterns, increasing it gradually if she tends to oversleep. She has also asked for recommendations on soothing nature sounds that can gently ease her into the day without causing abrupt disruptions.\n\nOver time, the user has expressed interest in exploring features that integrate her class schedule and assignment deadlines into the alarm system. This would allow her to set customized reminders for important academic events or adjust her wake-up time based on her daily commitments.\n\nThe user values the assistant's ability to provide personalized alarm suggestions based on her sleep habits and daily routine. She appreciates the option to snooze or temporarily disable alarms during exam periods or holidays when her schedule may vary.\n\nAdditionally, the user has inquired about integrating the alarm system with her smart home devices, such as gradually increasing the brightness of her bedroom lights or adjusting the thermostat temperature before her wake-up time. She prefers a straightforward and intuitive interface for managing her alarms, with clear visual indicators for active and upcoming alarms.\n\nOverall, the user's interactions with the alarm assistant revolve around optimizing her morning routine and academic schedule, while maintaining a gentle and natural wake-up experience tailored to her preferences.",
