She prefers to set a recurring alarm for 8:00 AM on weekdays, allowing her ample time to get ready for work.\n\nInitially, the user requested a simple alarm tone, but over time, she expressed a preference for upbeat music to help her start the day with energy and positivity. She has asked the assistant to recommend and set various upbeat song clips as her alarm sound, often providing feedback on which ones she finds most effective in waking her up without being jarring.\n\nThe user values the assistant's ability to remember her alarm preferences and set the alarm automatically without needing to provide all the details each time. She appreciates the occasional reminder the night before to confirm if she needs the alarm set for the following morning.\n\nOn weekends, the user tends to disable her weekday alarm or set a later one-time alarm, depending on her plans. She has provided feedback that the assistant should avoid setting weekend alarms unless explicitly requested.\n\nOver time, the user has explored additional features like setting multiple alarms with different tones for specific purposes (e.g., a softer tone for afternoon reminders) or snooze preferences. She values the assistant's adaptability in accommodating her evolving needs while maintaining her core weekday morning alarm routine.",

Rowling, Stephen King, and Gillian Flynn. She has often sought suggestions for gripping thrillers or immersive fantasy novels that can transport her to captivating fictional worlds. The assistant has provided her with tailored recommendations, such as \"The Silent Patient\" by Alex Michaelides or \"The Poppy War\" by R.F. Kuang, which she has enthusiastically added to her reading list.\n\nThe user has frequently engaged in discussions about her favorite books, such as \"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\" and \"Gone Girl,\" sharing her insights and perspectives on the characters, plot twists, and underlying themes. She has also expressed a keen interest in exploring book series, particularly the \"Harry Potter\" and \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" series, often seeking the assistant's guidance on the recommended reading order and supplementary materials.\n\nOver time, the user has developed a preference for both physical and ebook formats, depending on her convenience and reading environment.
