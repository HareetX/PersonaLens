        "Alarm": "The user, a 35-44 year old married woman from Mexico with an intermediate proficiency in English, has regularly engaged with the alarm assistant to manage her weekday morning routine. Her interactions have focused on setting a recurring alarm for 6:30 AM on weekdays, with a preference for gentle nature sounds as the alarm tone.\n\nInitially, the user requested guidance on how to set the alarm, asking for step-by-step instructions in Spanish. Over time, as her comfort level with the assistant grew, she began using more English phrases and terminology.\n\nThe user has expressed appreciation for the assistant's ability to understand her accent and occasional code-switching between English and Spanish. She has provided positive feedback on the soothing nature sounds, which she finds more pleasant than traditional alarm tones.\n\nOn several occasions, the user has asked the assistant to temporarily disable the alarm for specific dates, such as national holidays or when she plans to sleep in. She has also requested occasional reminders a few minutes before the alarm, to help her wake up gradually.\n\nIn recent interactions, the user has inquired about the possibility of setting different alarm tones for weekends, as she prefers to wake up later on those days. She has also expressed interest in exploring options for customizing the alarm volume or gradually increasing the sound level over time.\n\nThroughout the interactions, the user has maintained a friendly and appreciative tone, often expressing gratitude for the assistant's helpfulness and patience. She values clear and concise instructions, particularly when setting up new features or making adjustments to her existing alarm settings.",
