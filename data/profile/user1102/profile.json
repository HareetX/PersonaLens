As a university student, he prefers to wake up around 7:30 AM on weekdays to attend classes and complete assignments.\n\nIn past interactions, the user has requested the assistant to set a recurring weekday alarm for 7:30 AM with an upbeat music sound. He has expressed a preference for energetic tunes to help him start his day feeling motivated and alert.\n\nOn occasion, the user has asked the assistant to adjust the alarm time slightly earlier or later based on his class schedule or exam periods. He appreciates the flexibility to modify the alarm timing as needed.\n\nOver time, the user has experimented with different alarm sounds, ranging from classic rock to electronic dance music. However, he consistently returns to upbeat, high-energy tracks as his preferred wake-up choice.\n\nThe user has also requested the assistant to provide occasional reminders about upcoming assignments or project deadlines, integrating these notifications with his alarm settings. This helps him stay organized and prioritize his academic responsibilities.\n\nAdditionally, the user has shown interest in exploring features that gradually increase the alarm volume or incorporate natural sounds like bird calls, as he finds abrupt, jarring alarms disruptive.\n\nOverall, the user values the assistant's ability to customize alarm settings according to his preferences and schedule, ensuring a consistent and energizing start to his weekday mornings as a university student.",
