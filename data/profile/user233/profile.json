Past interactions reveal a preference for setting a recurring alarm for 7:30 AM on weekdays, with a gentle nature sound as the alarm tone.\n\nInitially, the user requested a simple weekday alarm to wake up for classes, but over time, she began exploring customization options. She asked the assistant to set different alarm tones for specific days, such as a soothing bird song for Mondays and a gentle rainfall sound for Fridays.\n\nThe user values the assistant's ability to adjust alarm volumes gradually, starting softly and increasing in volume over time. She has also requested the assistant to provide weather updates and traffic information when dismissing the alarm, to help plan her commute to the university.\n\nDuring exam periods, the user has asked the assistant to set additional alarms with reminders for study breaks and meal times, ensuring a balanced routine. She appreciates the assistant's proactive suggestions for adjusting alarm times based on her class schedule changes.\n\nOver time, the user has expressed interest in exploring more advanced features, such as integrating her alarms with smart home devices or setting location-based alarms for specific tasks or events. She values the assistant's clear and concise communication style, and appreciates personalized recommendations tailored to her preferences and routines.",
