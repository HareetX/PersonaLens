She appreciated the assistant's ability to make these changes seamlessly with simple voice commands.\n\nDuring one interaction, the user mentioned her struggle with waking up and asked for recommendations to improve her morning routine. The assistant suggested incorporating light stretches and provided healthy breakfast ideas to start the day energized.\n\nThe user has also experimented with different nature sounds for her alarm, trying options like ocean waves and rainforest ambiance. However, she consistently returned to the bird song, finding it the most pleasant way to begin her day.\n\nWhile the user's interactions have primarily focused on setting and adjusting her weekday alarm, she has occasionally requested weekend alarms for specific events or appointments.
