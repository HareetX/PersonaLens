She prefers to set a recurring weekday alarm for 7:00 AM, with a gentle nature sound to wake up peacefully.\n\nInitially, the user requested assistance in setting up a simple weekday alarm, expressing her preference for a calming alarm tone to start her day without feeling jarred. Over time, she began exploring additional features, such as setting weekend alarms with different tones and snooze durations.\n\nThe user values the assistant's ability to remember her preferences and provide personalized recommendations. For instance, when she mentioned feeling groggy in the mornings, the assistant suggested gradually increasing the alarm volume or incorporating gentle nature sounds like bird calls or ocean waves.\n\nAs her needs evolved, the user started requesting more advanced features, like setting multiple alarms for different activities or integrating with her calendar for event-based alarms. She appreciates the assistant's proactive reminders to adjust her alarms during holidays or daylight saving time changes.\n\nThe user has also provided feedback on the assistant's tone, preferring a warm and friendly approach while maintaining professionalism. She values clear and concise instructions, especially when setting up new alarm configurations or modifying existing ones.\n\nOver the years, the assistant has become an integral part of the user's morning routine, adapting to her changing needs and preferences.
