As a native English speaker with a university education, he prefers a professional yet friendly tone from the assistant.\n\nOne of the most common requests is to set a recurring alarm for 6:00 AM on weekdays, with a gentle nature sound as the alarm tone. The user appreciates the assistant's ability to confirm the details and provide a summary of the scheduled alarm.\n\nOver time, the user has occasionally asked to adjust the alarm time slightly earlier or later based on his schedule. He has also explored different alarm sound options, sometimes requesting recommendations for soothing nature sounds that can gently wake him up.\n\nIn addition to setting alarms, the user has inquired about features like gradually increasing alarm volume, customizing snooze duration, and integrating with smart home devices to control lights or temperature upon waking up. He values the assistant's clear explanations and step-by-step guidance for enabling these advanced settings.\n\nThe user has provided positive feedback on the assistant's reliability in managing his alarms, appreciating the consistent and accurate execution of his requests. He has also expressed interest in exploring additional sleep-related features, such as bedtime reminders or sleep tracking, as he aims to optimize his morning routine and overall well-being.",
