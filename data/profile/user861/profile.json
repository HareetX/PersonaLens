He appreciates the assistant's ability to make these temporary changes without altering the recurring weekday alarm settings.\n\nIn addition to setting alarms, the user has also sought assistance in managing existing alarms. He has asked the assistant to snooze or dismiss alarms on specific dates, such as during vacations or holidays, to avoid unnecessary disruptions.\n\nThe user values the assistant's ability to provide clear confirmations and reminders for alarm settings, ensuring he stays informed about upcoming alarms.
