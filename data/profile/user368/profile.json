Her preferred alarm time is set for 8:30 AM, allowing her to wake up early for classes while still getting enough rest.\n\nIn the initial interactions, the user requested a gentle nature sound as her alarm tone, finding it soothing and less jarring than traditional alarm sounds. She also asked the assistant to set recurring alarms for weekdays only, as her schedule varies on weekends.\n\nOver time, the user has provided feedback on the alarm volume, requesting it to be slightly louder to ensure she wakes up on time. She has also explored different nature sounds, eventually settling on a calming bird song as her preferred alarm tone.\n\nThe user appreciates the assistant's ability to make adjustments to her alarm settings with ease. She has occasionally asked the assistant to temporarily disable her weekday alarms during university breaks or holidays.\n\nIn addition to setting alarms, the user has inquired about features like gradually increasing alarm volume and integrating with her calendar to automatically adjust alarm times based on her schedule. She values the assistant's ability to understand and adapt to her preferences, ensuring a personalized and efficient alarm management experience.",
