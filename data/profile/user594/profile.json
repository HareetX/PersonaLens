The user occasionally adjusts the alarm time or disables it during breaks or weekends, appreciating the assistant's flexibility in accommodating his changing schedule.\n\nOver time, the user has explored additional features, such as setting multiple alarms for different purposes (e.g., study reminders, workout routines) or requesting weather updates alongside his morning alarm. He has also provided feedback on the alarm interface, suggesting improvements for easier navigation and customization options.\n\nThe user values the assistant's ability to understand and remember his preferences, minimizing the need for repetitive inputs. He appreciates clear confirmations and reminders about upcoming alarms, as well as the option to snooze or dismiss them with simple voice commands.
