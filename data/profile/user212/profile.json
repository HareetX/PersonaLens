She prefers a gentle nature sound to wake up at 6:30 AM on weekdays, allowing her enough time to get ready for work.\n\nIn their initial interactions, the user requested help setting up a recurring weekday alarm with the nature sound she found calming. She appreciated the assistant's ability to confirm the details and provide a summary of the scheduled alarm.\n\nOver time, the user began asking the assistant to snooze or adjust her alarm timing based on her schedule changes. For instance, when she had an early morning meeting, she would request the alarm to be set 30 minutes earlier. Conversely, if she had a late work shift, she would ask the assistant to delay the alarm by an hour.\n\nThe user has also explored different nature sounds for her alarm, occasionally requesting the assistant to surprise her with new gentle options like bird songs or ocean waves. She values the assistant's ability to remember her preferences while still offering variety.\n\nAdditionally, the user has sought the assistant's help in setting temporary alarms for specific dates, such as for early morning flights or important appointments. She appreciates the assistant's confirmation of these one-time alarms and the option to review or cancel them if needed.\n\nThroughout their interactions, the user has maintained a friendly and appreciative tone, often expressing gratitude for the assistant's responsiveness and ability to accurately manage her alarm preferences. She values the convenience and personalization the assistant provides in streamlining her morning routine.",
