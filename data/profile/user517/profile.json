The user has expressed a fondness for gentle, nature-inspired alarm sounds, finding them a soothing way to start his day. On several occasions, he has requested recommendations for calming alarm tones, such as bird songs or ocean waves.\n\nOver time, the user has developed a routine of confirming his alarm settings on Sunday evenings, ensuring a seamless transition into the workweek.
