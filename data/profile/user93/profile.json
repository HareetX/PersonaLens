They also asked for recommendations on motivational playlists to use as alarm sounds, expressing interest in trying different genres like rock or electronic music.\n\nOver time, the user has provided feedback on the alarm sounds, indicating a preference for more gradual volume increases and occasional variety in the music selection. They have also inquired about the ability to set location-based alarms, anticipating future travel for work.\n\nThe user values the assistant's ability to understand and adapt to their preferences, often requesting confirmations or summaries of the active alarms. They appreciate a straightforward and efficient interaction style, with clear acknowledgments when alarms are successfully set or updated.\n\nAdditionally, the user has shown interest in exploring features like customizable alarm labels (e.g., \"Work Day,\" \"Weekend Sleep-in\") and the ability to set recurring alarms with exceptions for holidays or specific dates. They have also inquired about integrating the alarm assistant with other smart home devices or calendar applications for a more seamless morning routine management.",
