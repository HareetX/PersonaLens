However, over time, she expressed a desire for a more energetic tone, as the nature sounds sometimes failed to rouse her from deep sleep.\n\nThe user has consistently provided positive feedback on the assistant's ability to set alarms accurately and appreciates the option to customize alarm labels, such as \"Work Day\" or \"Weekend.\" She has also requested the ability to set recurring alarms for specific date ranges, accommodating her occasional business travel.\n\nIn recent interactions, the user has shown interest in exploring features that gradually increase the alarm volume or integrate with smart home devices to simulate a natural wake-up experience, such as gradually brightening the lights in her bedroom.\n\nThe user values the assistant's clear and straightforward alarm confirmation messages, ensuring she doesn't miss important appointments or meetings. She has also inquired about the possibility of setting multiple alarms with varying tones and volumes, catering to her varying sleep patterns.\n\nOverall, the user's interactions reflect a desire for a customizable and reliable alarm system that adapts to her evolving needs as a working professional.
