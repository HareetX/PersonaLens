As a recent university graduate seeking employment, they value the assistant's ability to set consistent weekday alarms to maintain a structured routine.\n\nPast interactions often involve requesting a recurring weekday alarm for 9:00 AM, with a gentle nature sound to ease into their mornings. The user appreciates the assistant's capability to customize alarm tones, having expressed a preference for soothing natural sounds over harsh or jarring alarms.\n\nOver time, the user has experimented with different alarm times, occasionally requesting earlier or later alarms based on their job search commitments or interview schedules. They have also sought guidance on setting temporary alarms for specific dates, such as important application deadlines or follow-up reminders.\n\nThe user's interactions with the assistant reflect a preference for a friendly and accommodating tone, often expressing gratitude for the assistant's responsiveness and flexibility. They have provided feedback on the clarity of alarm instructions and have occasionally requested reminders on how to adjust or cancel alarms.\n\nAs their job search progresses, the user has begun exploring options for weekend alarms, anticipating potential shifts in their schedule.
