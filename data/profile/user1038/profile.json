        "Alarm": "The user, a single male in his late 20s or early 30s, works full-time and has a graduate degree. As a native English speaker of Asian descent living in Canada, he frequently interacts with the alarm assistant to manage his weekday morning routine.\n\nThe user prefers setting a recurring alarm for 7:00 AM on weekdays, allowing him sufficient time to get ready for work. He has expressed a liking for upbeat, energetic music as his alarm sound, often requesting recommendations for new, motivating songs or playlists to start his day.\n\nIn past interactions, the user has asked the assistant to set multiple alarms with staggered times, such as a initial alarm at 7:00 AM followed by additional alarms at 7:10 AM and 7:20 AM, to help him wake up gradually.
