As a native English speaker with a graduate degree, she prefers a polite and professional tone from the assistant.\n\nOne of her recurring requests is to set a gentle nature sound alarm for 7:00 AM on weekdays. She appreciates the assistant's ability to confirm the alarm details and provide a summary before setting it. Over time, she has occasionally asked to adjust the alarm time by 15-30 minutes earlier or later based on her schedule.\n\nThe user has expressed a preference for the assistant to provide a brief weather forecast along with the alarm confirmation. She has also requested the ability to snooze the alarm for 5-10 minute intervals, appreciating the assistant's patience in handling multiple snooze requests.\n\nIn instances where she has forgotten to set the alarm the previous night, the user has asked the assistant to set the recurring weekday alarm in the morning. She values the assistant's proactive reminders and ability to make adjustments on the fly.\n\nAdditionally, the user has occasionally requested weekend alarms for specific events or travel plans, appreciating the assistant's flexibility in accommodating her varying needs. She has provided positive feedback on the natural language interactions and the assistant's ability to understand and execute her alarm-related requests accurately.",
