        "Alarm": "The user, a young professional in their late 20s from New Zealand, has been actively engaging with the alarm assistant to streamline their morning routine. As a non-binary individual with a graduate degree, they value efficiency and personalization in their interactions.\n\nPast interactions have focused on setting a recurring weekday alarm for 7:30 AM, with a gradual increase in sound volume to gently wake them up. The user has expressed a preference for this alarm configuration, as it aligns with their work schedule and allows for a smooth transition into their day.\n\nOver time, the user has provided feedback on the alarm experience, requesting adjustments to the sound type and volume levels. They have experimented with different alarm tones, ranging from natural sounds like bird calls to more upbeat melodies, seeking the perfect balance between soothing and energizing.\n\nIn addition to the weekday alarm, the user has occasionally requested one-off alarms for specific events or appointments, appreciating the assistant's ability to accommodate their dynamic schedule.
