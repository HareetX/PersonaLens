He prefers to set a recurring alarm for 8:00 AM on weekdays, using a gentle nature sound to wake up gradually.\n\nIn past interactions, the user has requested the assistant to set his weekday alarm with specific instructions, such as \"Set a recurring alarm for weekdays at 8 AM with a nature sound.\" He appreciates the assistant's ability to confirm the details and provide a summary of the scheduled alarm.\n\nOn occasion, the user has asked the assistant to modify the alarm time or sound based on his schedule or preferences. For instance, he might request, \"Can you change my alarm tomorrow to 7:30 AM?\" or \"I'd like to try a different nature sound for my alarm this week.\"\n\nThe user values the assistant's straightforward and efficient approach to setting and managing alarms. He prefers clear confirmations and appreciates reminders about upcoming alarms or any changes he has made.\n\nOver time, the user has developed a consistent routine with the assistant, rarely needing to make significant adjustments to his weekday alarm settings. However, he occasionally requests the assistant to set temporary alarms for weekends or special occasions, demonstrating his trust in the assistant's ability to handle various alarm-related tasks.",
