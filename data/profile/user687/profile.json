Past interactions reveal a consistent preference for setting a recurring alarm for 6:00 AM on weekdays, with a gentle nature sound to ease her into the day.\n\nIn one instance, the user requested a new alarm tone recommendation that was soothing yet energizing, leading the assistant to suggest a selection of bird calls and flowing water sounds. She appreciated the personalized options and settled on a tranquil forest stream audio clip.\n\nThe user values efficiency and often asks the assistant to confirm or modify her existing 6:00 AM weekday alarm, occasionally adjusting the volume or snooze duration based on her schedule. She has expressed frustration with overly jarring alarm tones and prefers a gradual, peaceful wake-up experience.\n\nOver time, the user has explored the option of setting weekend alarms with later times, such as 8:00 AM, to accommodate her preference for sleeping in on her days off. She has also requested the ability to set temporary one-time alarms for specific dates, such as early morning flights or appointments.\n\nThe user appreciates the assistant's ability to provide concise confirmations and reminders about her active alarms. She has occasionally asked for tips on establishing a consistent sleep routine and has shown interest in integrating the alarm feature with other wellness or productivity tools. Overall, the user values a personalized and seamless alarm experience that aligns with her lifestyle and preferences.",
