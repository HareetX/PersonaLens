        "Alarm": "The user, a 25-34 year old married male working professional from the Netherlands, frequently interacts with the alarm assistant to manage his weekday morning routine. He prefers to set a recurring alarm for 7:30 AM on weekdays, allowing him ample time to get ready for work.\n\nIn past interactions, the user has expressed a preference for gentle, nature-inspired alarm sounds, finding them a more pleasant way to start his day compared to harsh, jarring tones. He has experimented with various nature sounds like bird songs, ocean waves, and gentle rainfall, ultimately settling on a soothing forest ambiance as his go-to alarm sound.\n\nThe user appreciates the assistant's ability to set alarms with a single voice command, often requesting \"Set an alarm for 7:30 AM tomorrow with the forest sound\" before going to bed. He has also asked the assistant to adjust the alarm volume to a moderate level, ensuring it's audible but not startling.\n\nOver time, the user has requested additional features, such as the ability to snooze the alarm for a customizable duration (typically 10 minutes) and the option to set a backup alarm a few minutes after the primary one, just in case he sleeps through the first alarm.\n\nWhile the user primarily relies on the alarm for weekday mornings, he has occasionally requested weekend alarms for specific events or appointments.
