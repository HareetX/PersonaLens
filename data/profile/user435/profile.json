She appreciates the ability to preview alarm tones and has occasionally asked for recommendations on relaxing sounds to start her day.\n\nThe user values consistency in her morning routine and has expressed frustration when the alarm fails to go off as scheduled. In such instances, she provides feedback to improve the reliability of the alarm system. She has also inquired about setting temporary alarms for specific dates, such as appointments or school events for her children.\n\nOver time, the user has explored additional features like gradually increasing alarm volume and snooze duration customization. She has shown interest in integrating the alarm with her smart home devices, such as slowly raising the bedroom lights or adjusting the thermostat temperature before the alarm goes off.\n\nWhile the user primarily relies on the weekday alarm, she occasionally sets weekend alarms with a later wake-up time or requests temporary alarms for travel or special occasions. Her interactions reflect a desire for a seamless and personalized alarm experience that aligns with her lifestyle as a homemaker and supports her morning routine.",
