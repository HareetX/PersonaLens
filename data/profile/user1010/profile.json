With a preference for gentle nature sounds as her alarm tone, she typically requests a recurring weekday alarm set for 7:00 AM.\n\nIn the past, the user has asked the assistant to modify her alarm time temporarily when she had to start work earlier or had an important appointment scheduled. She appreciates the assistant's ability to adjust the alarm accordingly and provide confirmation of the new setting.\n\nOn occasion, the user has sought recommendations for alternative soothing alarm sounds, expressing interest in exploring new options while maintaining a calming start to her day. The assistant has suggested various nature-inspired tones, such as ocean waves or bird songs, which the user has sampled and provided feedback on.\n\nOver time, the user has developed a routine of checking her alarm status with the assistant the night before, ensuring it is set correctly for the following morning. She values the assistant's clear and concise confirmations, as well as its ability to make adjustments swiftly based on her requests.\n\nAdditionally, the user has inquired about setting multiple alarms or reminders for specific tasks or events, appreciating the assistant's flexibility in accommodating her needs. She has also expressed interest in exploring features that gradually increase the alarm volume or integrate with smart home devices to control lights or temperature upon waking.",

She has frequently sought recommendations for books that delve into the complexities of race, identity, and the African-American experience, similar to Morrison's critically acclaimed novel \"The Bluest Eye.\" The assistant has provided her with a curated list of titles that resonate with these themes, such as \"Beloved\" and \"Song of Solomon,\" which the user has eagerly added to her reading list.\n\nIn addition to Morrison's works, the user has shown a keen interest in autobiographies and memoirs that offer intimate glimpses into the lives of influential figures. She has engaged the assistant in discussions about Maya Angelou's \"I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings,\" expressing her admiration for Angelou's resilience and the power of her storytelling.
