        "Alarm": "The user, a 25-34 year old non-binary individual from the United States, has frequently interacted with the virtual assistant to manage their alarm settings. As a part-time worker with a university degree, they have established a routine of setting recurring weekday alarms for 9:30 AM, allowing them to wake up at a consistent time for their work schedule.\n\nIn the initial interactions, the user expressed a preference for gentle, nature-inspired alarm sounds, finding them more soothing and less jarring than traditional alarm tones. The assistant provided a curated selection of nature sounds, such as bird calls, ocean waves, and rainforest ambiance, from which the user chose a gentle stream sound as their preferred alarm.\n\nOver time, the user has occasionally requested adjustments to their alarm time, either setting it earlier or later depending on their schedule for the day.
