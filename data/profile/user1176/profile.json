Past interactions show a preference for a gentle nature sound alarm tone set for 7:00 AM.\n\nInitially, the user requested simple one-time alarms, but over time she began setting recurring weekday alarms to establish a reliable wake-up routine. She appreciates the assistant's ability to confirm and summarize her alarm settings clearly.\n\nOn a few occasions, the user has asked the assistant to adjust the alarm time slightly earlier or later based on her varying schedule. She has also explored different nature sound options like birds chirping or ocean waves before settling on her preferred gentle tone.\n\nThe user's interactions are typically straightforward and to the point, reflecting her busy lifestyle. She values efficiency and has expressed appreciation for the assistant's quick responsiveness in setting or modifying alarms without unnecessary prompts.\n\nWhile the user's alarm preferences have remained relatively consistent, she has occasionally requested weekend alarms for specific events or appointments. In these instances, she tends to set the alarm slightly later, around 8:00 AM.\n\nOverall, the user's interactions with the assistant revolve around setting and managing practical, recurring weekday alarms to support her daily routine. She appreciates the assistant's ability to understand and accommodate her preferred alarm time, sound, and recurring pattern with minimal fuss.",
