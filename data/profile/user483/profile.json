She prefers a gentle nature sound to wake up at 7:00 AM sharp on weekdays.\n\nIn the initial interactions, she requested the assistant to set a recurring alarm for weekdays at 7:00 AM with a soothing nature sound. Over time, she has provided feedback on the alarm tones, expressing a preference for sounds like birds chirping or a gentle stream, which she finds peaceful for starting her day.\n\nThe user occasionally asks the assistant to modify the alarm time slightly, typically within a 15-minute window around 7:00 AM, to accommodate changes in her morning routine. However, she strongly prefers not to have alarms set on weekends, as she values uninterrupted sleep during those days.\n\nIn addition to setting alarms, the user has requested the assistant to provide weather updates and traffic information for her commute after dismissing the alarm. She appreciates the assistant's ability to provide these contextual details without prompting, as it helps her plan her morning more efficiently.\n\nThe user has also expressed interest in exploring features like gradually increasing alarm volumes or integrating with smart home devices to control lights or temperature upon waking up. She values the assistant's ability to remember her preferences and provide personalized recommendations aligned with her lifestyle and routines.",
